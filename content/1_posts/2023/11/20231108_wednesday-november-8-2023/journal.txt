I upgraded the (link: https://rudimentarylathe.org text: Rudimentary Lathe) blog to WordPress 6.4 so thought I'd give the (link: page://hgtse2w2GQEwI5SA text: new Twenty Twenty-Four theme a spin). Close, but nope.

I'm editing via the Kirby panel in my local installation and I was right, I like it better this way. No confusion about code vs content and which goes where first. I just type or edit, then `make deploy`.
