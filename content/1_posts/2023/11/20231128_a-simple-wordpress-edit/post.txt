Title: A simple WordPress edit?

Summary: <p>Editing posts outside of WordPress is possible but the side effects are gross</p>

Sorry to keep talking about WordPress, but using WordPress continues to irritate me, so I keep talking about it.

All I wanted to do was add a new item to the list on the (link: /changelog text: Changelog) page. I happened to be using MarsEdit, but when I loaded the page there I could tell I was still using Gutenberg…

Gross, right? So I dropped into the WordPress control panel and switched it to use the Classic editor. Then I reloaded it in MarsEdit and saw that it was marked up as an HTML unordered list. That sucks, because Markdown exists, so I changed it back to the block editor, and replaced the Gutenberg list with a Markdown block and pasted the existing list as Markdown.

Then, I reloaded the page in MarsEdit and saw this:

I don’t think I can deal with knowing this is what’s going on out there.

It’s possible that the next Changelog entry will start with “Changed blog back to…”[^toldyou]. It’s either that or I need to just give in and use Gutenberg all the time, in the control panel. Going with the flow might be the only viable option short of changing platforms again.

[^toldyou]: I was right. We're back on Kirby at baty.net
