Title: Display list of org-attach'ed files in buffer property

----

Summary: <p>I often want a list of attached files displayed <em>right in </em>the org-mode file.</p>

----

Text:

I use org-attach a lot. There's no way to see which files are attached without calling "org-attach-open" or whatever. Apparently something changed in Org-mode years ago that removed the function that did what I want. Found the followingÂ [on the mailing list](https://list.orgmode.org/87sg70vsvy.fsf@localhost/)...

```elisp
(defun org-attach-save-file-list-to-property (dir)
    "Save list of attachments to ORG_ATTACH_FILES property."
    (when-let* ((files (org-attach-file-list dir)))
      (org-set-property "ORG_ATTACH_FILES" (mapconcat #'identity files ", "))))
  (add-hook 'org-attach-after-change-hook #'org-attach-save-file-list-to-property)
```

Works great.
