I wonder what I would do every day if there was no way to tell people about it.

Finished the final season of "Reservation Dogs". It's a really good show.

I spent some time catching up on news today. Nearly everything I saw or read made me sick to my stomach. I need to go take some deep breaths because I don't much like anyone right now. See you in a bit.
