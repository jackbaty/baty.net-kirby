Title: WordPress theme Twenty Twenty-Four

----

Summary: I'll never understand how to use WordPress "Full-site" editing features.

I took a look at the new (link: https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/08/24/introducing-twenty-twenty-four/ text: Twenty Twenty-Four theme) released with WordPress 6.4. It has options to make most types of sites. I thought I'd try it, so I picked the "Blogging" template over on my stagnating (link: https://rudimentarylathe.org text: RudimentaryLathe.org blog)[^1]. It's clean and surprisingly simple. But it is all about the full-site editing in WordPress and I cannot seem to get my head around it. They keep improving it, but I still have no idea how to get around and make the changes I want to make. To me, it's just a mess and I don't like it.

[^1]: No guarantees that it'll still be using the theme by the time you see it.
