I follow a popular photographer on Flickr and YouTube and his content is mostly photographs of beautiful female models. He uses various cameras, lenses, and film stocks. I've noticed that all of his photos look basically the same, regardless of camera/lens/film. What's worse, the photographs, as beautiful as they are, are meaningless. He's basically shooting lens test charts with boobs.

I've been going through my old photo library today and it has reinforced what I keep thinking: Most of my favorite images were shot on film.

I can't believe I forgot to add an RSS link to this site. I ran into a Robb Knight's post asking to (link: https://rknight.me/please-expose-your-rss/ text: Please, Expose your RSS), so I did.
