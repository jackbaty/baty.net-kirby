Text:

Finished a roll in both the MP and M3 yesterday while celebrating Christmas with my parents, who leave for Florida next week. 

The rolls were dominated by photos of my new grandson, which I think is pretty normal.

Both rolls were HP5 with either the 35 or 50mm Summilux. Processed in H-110b and scanned on the V850.
