This is how I had built the Daily Notes blog in Tinderbox. I assumed it was not trivial, but I've learned that one can easily loop through each block in a post and render them individually.

Neat!</p>"},"id":"d73e8419-5ab0-4a83-b5a3-0f1a9ad1d326","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"text":"<p>Two phrases I think we can be done with: \"This is the way\" and \"Welcome to my TED talk.\"</p>"},"id":"937cf908-97d7-42a1-9237-3dc855faedf8","isHidden":false,"type":"text"}]
