I've spent another day building a site using Kirby CMS. I started with the completely empty "plainkit" version but have been pulling stuff over from the full demo as needed. Turns out I need a lot of stuff from there. I may have been better off starting with the full demo and deleting things I _don't_ need. Oh well.
