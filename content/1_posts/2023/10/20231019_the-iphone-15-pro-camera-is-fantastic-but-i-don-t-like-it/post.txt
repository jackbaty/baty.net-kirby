Title: The iPhone 15 Pro camera is fantastic but I don't like it

----

Summary: iPhone cameras are so good that they sometimes make awful, fake-looking photos.

Just look at this beautiful photo taken while walking Alice.

I'm glad to have such a nice photo from our walk, but I hate the way it looks. It hurts my eyes. It looks a preschooler found the HDR knob in Lightroom.

It doesn't matter how good the iPhone cameras get, until they stop forcing "computational photography" on me, I'll never use one for anything other than visual documentation.
