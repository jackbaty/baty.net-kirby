I've removed all traces of "cover" images in Kirby for now. I find the reliance upon featured images to be too much pressure. Most implementations require an all-or-nothing approach. I tried something different, it didn't work, so I cut it.

After the frustration of failing to do something interesting in Kirby, I did spend some time yesterday considering a move back to Hugo. That felt a bit reactionary, so I calmed down and decided to just keep typing here. Going back to all textarea/markdown/kirbytext for both regular and journal posts reduced my twitchiness about storage formats and having to add conditionals everywhere, so that's something.
