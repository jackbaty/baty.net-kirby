The only way I'd pay Musk $1 to join Twitter (X) is if I could mail him a check.

I was changing Kirby templates and code locally, but managing content directly on the live site. I of course became confused and lost some edits due to a mis-configured sync. I've decided to manage everything, including content, on my local machine, then rsync to production using make. It's one more step in the process, but much less confusing.

The downside of course is that I can't (well, _shouldn't_) post via my iPad/iPhone. Unless I access it via Tailscale. Hmmmm.
