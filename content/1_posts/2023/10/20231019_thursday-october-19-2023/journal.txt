The only way I'd pay Musk $1 to join Twitter (X) is if I could mail him a check.

I was making changes to Kirby templates and such locally but managing the content via the control panel live on the server. This of course became confusing and I lost some edits due to a mis-configured sync. I've decided to manage the site, _including content_, completely on my local machine, then rsync everything to production using my Makefile. It's one more step in the process, but much less confusing.
