I was making changes to Kirby templates and code locally, but managing content via the production site's control panel. This of course became confusing and I lost some edits due to a mis-configured sync. I've decided to manage everything, _including content_, on my local machine, then rsync to production using `make`. It's one more step in the process, but much less confusing.
