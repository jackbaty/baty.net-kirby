Title: App Launchers

----

Summary:

After years of using various app launchers on my Mac, can I get along without one? 

TLDR: Nope.

(link: http://pdxmph.micro.blog/2023/10/18/adopting-firefox-has.html text: Mike mentions) disabling Alfred and going back to using Spotlight as an app launcher. I've been having similar thoughts. 

I use (link: https://www.raycast.com/ text: Raycast), and its latest release notes are mostly around features of the $8/month subscription version. I thought, there's no way I'm paying monthly for what's basically a glorified app launcher, which brought me back to thinking about Spotlight.

My first app launcher was (link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksilver_(software) text: Quicksilver) and it immediately became an intregal part of using a Mac. From there I moved to (link: https://www.obdev.at/products/launchbar/index.html text: LaunchBar) and then to (link: https://alfred.app/ text: Alfred) before settling on Raycast. I still sometimes fire up LaunchBar because it's great for navigating the filesystem. And it's faster.

My first week with Raycast was spent installing extensions and writing little scripts: everything from deploying my websites to resizing images to creating notes. Then, I barely used any of them. The only fancy Raycast extension I use regularly is for resizing images selected in the Finder.

So after getting all huffy about not paying for a Raycast subscription, I dropped all the way back to Spotlight. It lasted two hours. I don't want to even use a computer if there's no clipboard history. If I need to install another app to get that, then why not just use the one built into the app launcher? 

As a way to feel better about all this, I'm going to run with Alfred today and see how it feels.
