Title: Using both Denote and Org-roam

----

Summary: Denote’s claim to fame is simplicity and structured file naming. Org-roam is great for daily notes, heading-level linking, and the cool visual graph.

Text: [{"content":{"text":"[Denote](https://protesilaos.com/emacs/denote) and [Org-roam](https://orgroam.com/) are both great Emacs packages for taking notes. I’ve used each of them extensively and have [waffled between them](https://baty.net/2023/back-to-org-roam/) regularly. I started wondering if it makes sense to use _both_. It does!.\n\nDenote’s claim to fame is simplicity and structured file naming. Org-roam is great for daily notes, heading-level linking, and the cool visual graph.\n\nI’ve sometimes felt (probably irrationally) icky about using Org-roam because of its dependency on external sqlite libraries. Now, with Emacs 29+, sqlite is built in, so I feel better about it.\n\nWhat I wanted was Org-roam’s features with Denote’s naming conventions, so I installed both packages. The trick to making it seamless was to adjust the default Org-roam template so that it creates files with the proper names. Here’s how I’ve done that."},"id":"1de12f25-9c7a-40e4-8ec4-4cd92a004184","isHidden":false,"type":"markdown"},{"content":{"code":"(setq org-roam-capture-templates\n        '((\"d\" \"default\" plain \"%?\"\n           :target\n           (file+head \"%<%Y%m%dT%H%M%S>--${slug}.org\" \":PROPERTIES:\\n:ID:          %<%Y%m%dT%H%M%S>\\n:END:\\n#+title:      ${title}\\n#+date:       [%<%Y-%m-%d %a %H:%S>]\\n#+filetags: \\n#+identifier: %<%Y%m%dT%H%M%S>\\n\\n\")\n           :immediate-finish t\n           :unnarrowed t)))","language":"lisp"},"id":"19a4a11d-6bbb-40b5-84dc-78284841b068","isHidden":false,"type":"code"},{"content":{"text":"I had been using GUIDs for the ID: property but here I’ve switched to IDs based on datestamps so they match the “identifier”. I’m not sure this is a great idea. You may also notice that I’m not bothering with tagging here. I don’t always use tags, anyway, so I don’t feel the need to complicate the capture process. Besides, when I do want to add tags I can use `denote-keywords-add` and Denote adds to the filetags property and updates the filename automatically. This is one of the nice things about having both packages available.\n\nIf I want to rename/tag a bunch of files at once, I can use the `denote-dired-*` commands. Any time the database gets out of whack when doing this, I just run `org-roam-db-sync` and we’re back in action.\n\nOne other bonus is that all of my original Denote links (e.g. denote:ABC123) still work so I haven’t bothered converting everything to use Org’s id: style links. In order to include my Denote files in Org-roam’s database, I did need to add an ID: property to the top of each of them. Fortunately, I use the ID property for org-download/org-attach so most of them already had IDs.\n\nUsing both Denote and Org-roam seems to be working fine. Am I missing anything that might cause issues later?"},"id":"db98140a-71d9-4d3b-9187-e8bd19ab2653","isHidden":false,"type":"markdown"}]
