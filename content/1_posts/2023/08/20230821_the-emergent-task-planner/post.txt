DSri Seah’s (Formerly David Seah) Emergent Task Planner (ETP) is a paper-based planning tool that I used from 2012 through 2018. Here’s an example from 10 years ago today:

Lately I’ve been using a yellow legal pad on my desk instead of my usual A5 notebook. I like having the extra room, but there’s no real structure built in, so I also use the little Hobonichi Techo for listing a few important tasks for the day.

While organizing some files on my laptop this weekend, I ran into a folder full of scanned ETP pages and was reminded how effective they can be at time blocking, planning, and miscellaneous record keeping. I’ve been feeling a bit overwhelmed when staring at the computer, so I’m going to try the ETPs for daily planning again.

I used to use pre-printed ETP pads but I see they’re not currently available, however there’s a downloadable PDF on (link: https://davidseah.com/node/the-emergent-task-planner/ text: DSri’s Website).

If you’re a fan of analog planning tools, I very much recommend you give the Emergent Task Planner a try.
