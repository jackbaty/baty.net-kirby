I’ve been feeling a bit overwhelmed when staring at the computer, so I’m going to try the ETPs for daily planning again.</p><p>I used to use pre-printed ETP pads but I see they’re not currently available, however there’s a downloadable PDF on <a href=\"https://davidseah.com/node/the-emergent-task-planner/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">DSri’s Website</a>.</p><p>If you’re a fan of analog planning tools, I very much recommend you give the Emergent Task Planner a try.</p>"},"id":"ec50d1b8-d6b3-4068-b3b6-837973819f25","isHidden":false,"type":"text"}]
