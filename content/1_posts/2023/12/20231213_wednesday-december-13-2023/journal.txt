I like Kirby, but I miss the collect-individual-notes-into-a-daily-post that I'd built for (link: https://daily.baty.net text: daily.baty.net) in Tinderbox. I bet there's a way to build something similar using Kirby, but I'm not sure I know enough about Kirby yet to pull it off.

Well, the most recent position I applied for, and one for which I'm more than qualified for, is "going to move ahead with another candidate". Disappointing, but onward, I guess.

I paid $75 for the OmniFocus 4 upgrade from v3. I figure I'd give the old OF another run. It's a very powerful app, but suffers because of it. Still, I love the built-in review feature. Also, I'm trying to move tasks out of Org-mode, so this was incentive.

## Emacs is neat

I finally found a case for using (link: https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Indirect-Buffers.html text: indirect buffers) in Emacs. Kirby content files are text, but not formatted using "normal" YAML. This puts the "Text:" field in the middle of the other fields, making it less convenient to edit. So, I can just mark the Text: field and run `edit-indirect-region` and poof, I'm off in a new buffer containing only that section of the original file. Emacs is neat. All that's left is to force visual-line-mode and markdown-mode in the new buffer.

Oh, I'd forgotten about `narrow-to-region` which is even better for this. I narrow to Org-mode headings all the time, but didn't consider using it here by selecting the "Text:" field and narrowing to just that region. This way, all of my settings remain intact and I don't have to worry about restoring them in the indirect buffer.
