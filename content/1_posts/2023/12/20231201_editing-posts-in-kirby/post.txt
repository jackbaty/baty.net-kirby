It's such a pleasant change to be editing posts in Kirby rather than WordPress. The panel is fast, clean, and simple. It's also easily customizable using Blueprints.

It's nice when the options for editing blog posts fit my mood and preferences. And it's nice not fighting with that other platform's editor :).
