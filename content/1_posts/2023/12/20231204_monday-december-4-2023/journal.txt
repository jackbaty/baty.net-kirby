I'm still writing things down in four places. Sometimes I'll rewrite the same thing in several of those places, just in case. I'm terrible at this.

Enjoyed watching (link: /@/page/H4XtKcShWU5gm69a text: The Holdovers (2023)). I should make a movie review template for Kirby but maybe just a Movie tag will be enough. I don't need more data entry tasks.

Some days I want to do *everything* in public. Other days I want to remove every single trace of myself from the internet.
