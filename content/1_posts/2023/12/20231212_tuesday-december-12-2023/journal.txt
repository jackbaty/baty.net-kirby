Text: Started reading a couple of books this week that feel like an indication of something. First is "The Intellectual Life" by Antonin Sertillanges. Second is "The Creative Act: A Way of Being" by Rick Rubin. Can you tell I'm reaching for different things at the same time? I don't know if it's a contradiction or an opening up.
