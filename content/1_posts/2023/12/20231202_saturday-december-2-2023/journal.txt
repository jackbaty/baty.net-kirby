Text: I was saddened to learn that Elliott Erwitt, my favorite photographer, died this week. I just a week ago ordered his book (link: /@/page/rIuNSkNNJtZnBJmK text: Personal Best). It is scheduled to arrive today and reading it will be a melancholy journey. Magnum has published a memorial piece: [Remembering Elliott Erwitt (1928â€“2023)](https://www.magnumphotos.com/arts-culture/remembering-elliott-erwitt-1928-2023/)
