I was saddened to learn that Elliott Erwitt, on of my favorite photographers, died this week. I just a week ago ordered his book [Personal Best](/@/page/rIuNSkNNJtZnBJmK). It is scheduled to arrive today and reading it will be a melancholy journey. Magnum has published a memorial piece: [Remembering Elliott Erwitt (1928–2023)](https://www.magnumphotos.com/arts-culture/remembering-elliott-erwitt-1928-2023/)

I wanted to try re-scanning an old transparency of mine, but I am unable to find any of my slides from the early 80s. They've gotta be here *somewhere*, because I never throw away anything photographic, but I'll be damned if I can put my hands on them. It's a little terrifying.
