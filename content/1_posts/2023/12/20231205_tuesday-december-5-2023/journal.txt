Text: It's like I'm memory-wiped once every few days/months/years. An example: I recently struggled with how to make contact sheets from 6-frame negative strips. I solved the problem nicely, but later found that I'd gone through (link: https://archive.baty.net/2012/20127cutting-negatives/ text: this exact process twelve years ago). This sort of thing happens to me all the time.
