Title: The Daily Notes Dilemma

Summary: You see, I have this wiki, and for a couple of years, I have written a new entry in it (nearly) every day. These "daily notes" have been interspersed and interlinked with the rest of the wiki's content. It works, but I don't love it.

Text: [{"content":{"text":"**TL;DR**: [daily.baty.net](https://daily.baty.net/).\n\nYou see, I have [a nice wiki](https://rl.baty.net/), and for a couple of years, I have written a new entry in it (nearly) every day. These “daily notes” have been interspersed and interlinked with the rest of the wiki’s content. It works, but I don’t love it.\n\nWriting in [TiddlyWiki](https://tiddlywiki.com/) is fine. It’s super easy, but it’s also a little clunky, which quickly becomes friction. And the experience for visitors is weird if you’re not familiar with TiddlyWiki. Also, there’s no RSS feed. I sometimes consider this a feature, because it’s nice writing freely and knowing it’s not “going anywhere”. On the other hand, if I were someone wanting to follow along with me, I’d want a damn RSS feed.\n\nSo, I periodically waffle between writing my daily posts on the wiki and on a “real” blog. One thing that has kept me in the wiki is that I can easily link things from my daily notes posts to the more permanent entries. This helps build a network of links. I love the _idea_ of all this linking back and forth, but in practice, it’s not as useful as I’d hoped. TiddlyWiki works better when each distinct idea or thing is created as a separate “tiddler”. I’ll create a new tiddler about something, link to that something, and then transclude the tiddler in that day’s daily. And then I almost never actually _take advantage of_ all that work. So why bother? I mean, it’s not as if I’m trying to build some sort of [Zettlekasten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten) here.\n\nI love writing in [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) and keeping everything [formatted as Org-mode files](https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/). I like [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) for blogging and I like the way the rendered site looks. TiddlyWiki is easier overall but Emacs/Org/Hugo is more fun for me and I believe it results in a nicer experience for visitors.\n\nAll that to say I’m once again back to using a “real” blog for my daily notes. I’ve committed enough to this that I’ve added a link in the navigation here. You can follow along at [daily.baty.net](https://daily.baty.net/).\n\nAn RSS feed for daily.baty.net is available both [on its own](https://daily.baty.net/index.xml) and as part of my [Everything Feed](https://baty.net/everything)."},"id":"096a37da-a475-4b13-807b-65fe1eda1a21","isHidden":false,"type":"markdown"}]
