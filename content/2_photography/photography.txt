Title: Photos

Text:

I try to take photographs every day. My favorite subjects are the people and things close to me. They are the parts of my life that I wish to keep record of.

I shoot mostly on black and white film using a Leica M rangefinder camera. I have always been most comfortable using a rangefinder and the film Leicas are timeless, incredibly well-built, and as beautiful to the touch as they are to look at.

I process film myself and then make silver gelatin prints in my darkroom. My feeling is that a photograph isn't "real" until it's been printed. I also scan each roll using a flatbed (Epson V850) scanner. I've tried various methods of scanning with digital cameras but don't like the process or results.

Most of my images can be found on [Flickr](https://flickr.com/photos/jbaty). I've recently also started sharing them on [Glass](https://glass.photo/jbaty).

For those who are curious about gear, I keep a list on my [Uses](https://baty.net/uses/) page.
