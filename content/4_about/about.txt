(image: 2023-jack-headshot.jpg class: small-image left)

Founding partner at Fusionary Media (1995-2020) where I was a project/product manager, developer, and de-facto CTO. We sold the company in 2020 and, after an extended sabbatical, I’m now ready for my next thing. I’m good at product/project management, process, requirements, user experience, documentation, and communication. If there’s anything you think I could do for you, (link: page://oVmmR9h6SoeekkBJ text: hire me). I’ve been at this for a long time. I enjoy working with both clients and dev teams.

I love photography, writing, and tinkering with software and web technologies.
