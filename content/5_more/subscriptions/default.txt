Subheadline: Things I pay for every month

----

Text:

I prefer to avoid paying subscriptions. The problem is that some things don't have free or pay-and-keep options. Or if they do they're not worth the trouble, so here we are.

I keep my list of subscriptions in an Org-mode file so I'll just copy and paste the table here. I'm sure I've missed a few. 

Not all of these are actually paid for monthly. Some I pay for annually, but have calculated the monthly costs here (in USD).
