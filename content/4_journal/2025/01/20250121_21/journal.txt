Title: 21 January 2025 (Tuesday)

Summary: 

----

Text: The dog got me up at 2:20 AM and insisted we go for our morning walk right then. It was -1Â°F. This made it both too early and too cold. It also means it's now 05:42 AM and I've been up for more than three hours already. Did some yoga, read some news (big mistake!). Drinking coffee and trying not to let despair seep in through the cracks.
