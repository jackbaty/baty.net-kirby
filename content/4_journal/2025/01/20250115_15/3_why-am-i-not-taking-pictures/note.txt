Title: Why am I not taking pictures?

----

Text:

I wrote on Mastodon yesterday that I feel like I've given up on photography as a creative pursuit. It was a throwaway post, but it's been bugging me since.

My rooms are full of cameras, lenses, and film. I'm surrounded by equipment for scanning, printing, developing, enlarging, viewing, etc. I _love_ photography. And yet most of it sits idle. I'll snap a couple of mirror self-portraits when I'm bored. Or maybe take a photo of the dog when she's being cute. Otherwise, nothing.

I don't know if this is just a brief slump or if it's a sign of a larger shift. I hope it's the former. I'd hate to lose interest in the one thing that still holds my interest.
