Title: Nick Cave defends the awkward first line of O Wow O Wow

----

Text:

I personally found the first line of "O Wow O Wow" from Wild God to be cringy.

"She rises in advance of her panties"

[Cave responds to criticism of the line - Issue #309](https://www.theredhandfiles.com/this-line-on-wow-o-wow/):

> as its creator I feel the need to defend it – not just out of some paternal urge, but because I have always thought the line was rather good. Truthfully, when I wrote the first verse of ‘O Wow O Wow‘, I was so pleased, that I took the rest of the day off!

And suggests how Anita, who passed in 2021, might feel about it:

> Understanding Anita, as I do, I know she loves this song and is happy to be occasionally awakened and called back to us. The dead are glad to be remembered. As for the contentious first line, Neil, I think she likes it a lot.
