Title: I should paint myself into a corner

----

Text: For a year or so, I've been working to wean myself from as much macOS-only software as possible. The idea lurking behind this move has been, "What if I move to Linux?". I can't shake the thought, even though it would be a terrible idea. As a counter, now I'm wondering if I should use _nothing but_ macOS-only software. That way it would simply be too much work to switch, so maybe I'll stop thinking about it. Yeah right.
