Title: My first homemade 3D print

----

Text:

I have no useful experience with 3D modeling software, so I figured it was time to jump in. My first project was to stop the Baron Fig Squire pen from rolling off my desk 30 times a day.

I thought about making a clip, but that felt too complicated, so I made a simple ring with a couple of flat sides. The problem was that it still rolled. The flat bits weren't enough to stop it, given any momentum.

Instead of a fancy solution, I just added a tiny nubbin to the ring. It's not pretty or elegant, but it works. 

Crude but effective.
