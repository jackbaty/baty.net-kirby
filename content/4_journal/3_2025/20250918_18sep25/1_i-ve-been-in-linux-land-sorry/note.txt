Title: I've been in Linux land, sorry

Text: For the past week or so I've been neck deep moving most of my "stuff" to Linux. Specifically [Omarchy](https://omarchy.org). It's consumed me, so I haven't been as interested in posting. This will subside at some point and things will be back to whatever the new normal is.
