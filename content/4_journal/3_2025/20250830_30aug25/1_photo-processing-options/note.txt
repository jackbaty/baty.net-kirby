Title: Photo processing options

----

Text:

Having a bit of a photo processing software showdown this week. I want something that works well with [Mylio](https://mylio.com) as a standalone editor or possibly a Photoshop plugin. So far I'm testing [Nik Collection by DxO](http://nikcollection.dxo.com) and [Radiant Photo](http://radiantimaginglabs.com). I wish I could buy just [Silver Efex](https://nikcollection.dxo.com/nik-silver-efex/) from the Nik Collection for like $69 or something, but they don't offer that. I may end up buying both packages, which seems like overkill.

Well guess what, I canceled my Mylio order. Difficult decision, but probably for the best.
