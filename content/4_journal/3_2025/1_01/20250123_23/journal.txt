My dog's schedule is all out of whack. This morning she was up and ready to go at 1:45 AM. I put her off until around 3:00 but gave in and took her for a walk. Now it's 4:45 and I've walked a mile, done some yoga, wrote in my journal, and waffled about where to post this. Another day.

Oh FFS, I see we're going to be judging apologies again. Whatever you do, try to make it as difficult as possible for people to apologize. Great idea.
