Title: Stepping back from social media

----

Text: I need another break from social media. People I admire and respect are behaving poorly over there, and it's making me irritable. I don't care if they're right or wrong. Presentation matters, and I don't approve of the presentation. I'm well within tolerance if I choose not to listen for a bit. I'll head back in a day or week or month, probably, but right now, being there is bad for my health.
