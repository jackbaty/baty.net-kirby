Text: I was just looking through previous posts about using Kirby for this site. There was a flurry of activity about a year ago, during which I moved my editing process from the server to my local machine and back again. I also switched back and forth between Kirby and Hugo. And back again. I would love to spend the entirety of 2025 using Kirby, but my MTBF (Mean Time Between Formats) has averaged 30-60 days. We'll see.
