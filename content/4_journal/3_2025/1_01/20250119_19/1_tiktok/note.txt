Title: TikTok

----

Text: It looks like TikTok is off the air. This doesn't affect me because I don't use TikTok. On one hand, I feel bad for the millions of people who love it. On the other hand, maybe it'll be good for people to go do something instead that doesn't involve scrolling their phone as entertainment. What's worse is that when Trump inevitably "saves" TikTok, which I believe he should, he'll be the hero in the story for those millions.
