Title: Lifestack

Text: I (intermittently) maintain a page containing a list of things I use. Most people seem to call theirs "Uses" at a /uses slash page. I have gone back to calling mine my "Lifestack" and it is now at [/lifestack](/lifestack). (/uses will redirect). I dunno, "Lifestack" is more fun.
