Title: Kirby revived

----

Text: I was in a mood for change this afternoon, so I dusted off the Kirby version of my blog, cleaned things up, refactored the blueprints, and migrated the content from Hugo (since last time). I spent like 4 hours on this, and now I've forgotten why I started it. I suppose I should deploy it and enjoy my sunk cost fallacy.
