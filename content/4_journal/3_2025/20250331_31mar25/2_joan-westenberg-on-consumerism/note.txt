Text:

> We’ve turned living into editing. When every meal is a performance, every outfit a brand decision, every hobby a pitch, there’s no space left for boredom. Or rest. Or actual pleasure. We scroll through each other’s highlight reels while quietly assembling our own, haunted by the suspicion that everyone else is doing it better—and forgetting to live in any of it.
