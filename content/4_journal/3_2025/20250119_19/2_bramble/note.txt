Title: Bramble

Text:

Over on The Online Photographer, Mike was (link: https://theonlinephotographer.typepad.com/the_online_photographer/2025/01/the-artists-statement-bones-part-iii.html text: poking fun) at someone who made a bunch of photos of bramble. You know, bushes or sticks or what-have-you. I agree that photos of bramble are boring and meaningless, but I've taken a *lot* of photos of brambles and I kind of love them. I just don't share them. I also don't have a contrived artist's statement about them. I just like looking at them. So what?
