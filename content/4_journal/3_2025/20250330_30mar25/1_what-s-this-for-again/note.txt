Title: What's this for, again?

----

Text: Just as I expected, now that Daily is all fired up, I'm once again wondering what it's for. Or, more precisely, what belongs here vs on baty.net? I've made this bed, I guess. I like having this blog as an even-more-informal place to take notes. The problem is that I made it too good, so I want to do more here. The lines blur, once again.
