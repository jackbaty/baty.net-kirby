I woke up this morning and remembered that I'd moved this from Tinderbox to Kirby. Oh right, now I have to figure out all the things I didn't want to deal with when I moved _away_ from it like a month ago. You know, as I do.

Baty.net has passed more than 1,000 visits for the last few days and I'm not sure how I feel about that. Part of me wishes I was oblivious, because now I feel like I _owe_ people something. Also, with too many people listening, I'm less inclined to speak freely and openly for fear that I'll spend too much time defending myself to strangers. It makes me want to write more here and on the wiki, since not as many people are listening.
