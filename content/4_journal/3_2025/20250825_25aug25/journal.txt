At the prompting of just about everyone I know, I had a 5-hour ADHD screening today. I won't know any results for a couple of weeks, but right now I feel like I failed an IQ test.

Oh cool, typing response is lagging just a teeny bit and it's driving me buggy. I wondered if it was my new Apple Magic Keyboard with Touch ID because that would be exactly the kind of thing technology does to me these days, but typing on the HHKB felt the same. It's intermittent and doesn't seem related to CPU or anything. Oh well, on the plus side it got me to dig out the HHKB again, which I _love_ and should maybe have never stopped using.

The older I get, the less I care about Operating Systems.

I read the news today, Oh Boy! Seriously, every single story shocked, saddened, or horrified me. Sometimes all three. Even more than usual. What the fuck is going on with people?
