Title: Emacs churn

----

Text:

At the beginning of the year I wanted to try Emacs Easy Modeâ„¢. Yeah, I know, there's no such thing, but I thought I'd *try*. I ditched my vanilla configuration for Doom and I switched my convoluted Denote/Howm combo for Org-roam.

This morning, I reverted all those changes.
