Summary:

Text: I just noticed that the tag searches don't work here, for some reason. I don't feel like debugging, so this fits with the theme this week, I guess. Oh wait, the search works, but not at the individual Note level. Sigh, I forgot this used to be for both posts and journal entries, but I gutted it when making it just for the journal bits. Why do I do this to myself?
