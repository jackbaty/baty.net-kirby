Title: Howm updates

----

Text: During the first 6 months using (link: https://kaorahi.github.io/howm/ text: Howm), I kept changing the format I used. I started with plain .txt files then moved to Markdown, then to org and back again a few times. What a mess. I'm an Org mode person, so  I spent rather too long this morning converting and renaming everything to .org. I need to stick with this, now.
