Text: I can't believe this Kirby CMS thing still works. Not entirely true. I tried installing PHP/PHP-FPM and Co. on the FreeBSD server, but it threw errors I couldn't fix, so I put it up on the old Ubuntu server and that worked straight away. Then, I got mad that I'd given up, so I tried again and figured out that I'd missed a package or two when installing php. Works now. You're soaking in it.
