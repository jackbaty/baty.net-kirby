Title: When I'm trying to stay off the socials

----

Text: When I'm trying to stay off social media, I need something to distract me. Today, I'm feeling like playing with [Tinderbox](https://eastgate.com/Tinderbox) and [TiddlyWiki](https://tiddlywiki.com/). One side effect is that I'm blogging over at [daily.baty.net](https://daily.baty.net), instead. I'll also be tinkering with [the wiki](https://wiki.baty.net). Sorry to scatter stuff around, but it's fun!
