Title: Blogging fatigue

Text: I wrote [How much more is there to say?](https://baty.net/posts/2025/08/how-much-more-is-there-to-say/) this morning, because I haven't felt like writing blog posts. I'm more inclined to jot things here and not worry about structure or length or the appropriateness of topics. It's all I have the energy for, right now.
