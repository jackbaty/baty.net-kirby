Title: We're running on Kirby now

Text:

I've migrated this daily.baty.net site to Kirby CMS. It has been a static site managed by [Tinderbox](https://eastgate.com/Tinderbox) for a long time. I love Tinderbox, but now that baty.net is back on Hugo, I really wanted a playground for learning more about Kirby. So, here we are.

Your RSS feed is probably complaining right now. Sorry about that.
