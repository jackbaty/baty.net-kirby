Title: Replacing make with just

----

Text: I've been slowly working on migrating my Makefiles to [just](https://github.com/casey/just). Just is a command runner and doesn't try to be a decades-old build system. I just need a command runner :). The syntax is similar enough that converting them is pretty trivial.
