Title: Couldn't stand the weather

----

Text: I removed the weather information from journal posts here. I'll likely do it on the other blog, too. It's only a little work to maintain, but it's work that doesn't get me anything. No one, not even me, cares what the weather was on a given day, so why bother with it? If it's important to the "story", I'll add it to the post.
