Text: I have little interest in maintaining a custom build of _anything_. For example, this blog is managed using Kirby. I had to make all the templates myself so that it works the way I like. Now, I barely remember how anything works and heaven help me if I need to fix or change something. Maybe I'll just use it until it breaks.
