Title: Feedspool

----

Text: [Les Orchard](https://lmorchard.com) made a thing, [Feedspool](https://github.com/lmorchard/feedspool-go), that works as a CLI interface for managing/reading RSS feeds. It uses sqlite and has a bunch of fun things built in. I'm pretty content with Elfeed in Emacs, but Feedspool is an interesting take.
