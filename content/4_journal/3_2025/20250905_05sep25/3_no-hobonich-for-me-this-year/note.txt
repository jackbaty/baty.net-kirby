Title: No Hobonichi for me this year

----

Text: This is the first year since 2013 that I won't be ordering a Hobonichi planner. For the past few years I've started out hot and heavy like always, then for the remaining 6 to 8 months, most pages end up blank. I love those little planners, but I no longer need them, I guess.
