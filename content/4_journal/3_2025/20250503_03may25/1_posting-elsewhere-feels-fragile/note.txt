Title: Posting elsewhere feels fragile

----

Text: I assume it's possible, because most people who blog do it, but I struggle to get comfortable posting to a personal blog using a CMS (e.g. Ghost). I can't seem to get over knowing that it's all "out there". It's probably irrational, but still makes me twitchy. My blog is like a journal. I don't like the idea of my journal being at all fragile. Anything other than local-first static HTML feels fragile.
