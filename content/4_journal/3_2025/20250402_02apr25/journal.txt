Text: Spent time this morning organizing photos from last month's Capture One session and various folders of film scans. I thought I'd like using Capture One sessions during the month, then importing them into a master catalog. It was tedious and error prone, so now I'm having second thoughts. If I was just using Lightroom this would have been done as I went along.
