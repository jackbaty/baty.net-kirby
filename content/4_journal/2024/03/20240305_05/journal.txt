Alluvasudden CTRL-e stopped moving the point to end of line in Emacs (Evil mode) and I really hate when stuff like this happens.

Speaking of breakage, Python never works on my machine. Every single time I upgrade Python half of my scripts break. How do I nuke & pave Python?

I hate the word "sublime"

I'm trying hard not to be a downer today but I feel like a downer today. Maybe ignore me until tomorrow? I feel so buried in tech that it's hard to breath.

It's been nice only posting to one place for a couple days. Takes the pressure off. I wish I didn't get bored, though.
