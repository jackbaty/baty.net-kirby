Text: After yesterday's Kirby->Hugo-Kirby debacle, I've been thinking about why I spend so much time farting around with and on my blog. Fair question, and one I don't really have an answer to. I guess it's my little place on the internet and I like to have the furniture arranged just so. But "just so" changes all the time, so I keep trying new configurations. It's fun. Also useless, and nobody but me cares, but still.
