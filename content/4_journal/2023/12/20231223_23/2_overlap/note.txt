Title: Overlap

----

Text: Have you noticed that when we all share lists of the things we use, workspaces, processes, software, etc. that the overlap is about 90%? I don't need to see more workstations with a Grovemade shelf or to know that someone uses Things for tasks. It's kind of boring now, to me.
