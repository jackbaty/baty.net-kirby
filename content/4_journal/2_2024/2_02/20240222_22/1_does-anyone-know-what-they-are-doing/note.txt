I read this in a post today:

> The truth is this: *Nobody* knows what the fuck they're doing.
> If someone seems like they have their shit together, either they are presenting you with a completely false front, or they are in a season of The Total Occasional Fluke of Everything Apparently Going Right and Coming Together.

I call bullshit. Just because you or I don't know what we're doing, doesn't mean nobody does. Some people know exactly what they're doing and are good at it. I hate them, of course.
