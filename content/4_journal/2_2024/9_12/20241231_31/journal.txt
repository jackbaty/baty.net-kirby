I guess this is a wrap on 2024, then. It's been quite a year, blog-wise. I won't claim it was productive or even creative, but still...quite a year. I see a lot of year-end summary posts, but I can't be bothered to write one. See 2022 and 2023, I guess.

Cool, but the opposite of what I'm looking for this year.
