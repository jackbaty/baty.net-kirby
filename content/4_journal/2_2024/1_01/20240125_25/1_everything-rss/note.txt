Title: Everything.rss

Text: I'm still looking for the best way to combine the RSS feeds from all my sites into a single MegaFeed. Currently, I'm self-hosting an instance of RSS-Bridge to create a combined feed. I am redirecting https://baty.net/everything.rss to that feed, in case you were subscribed and things just got weird. It may change again soon, so I apologize in advance. I wrote a few details here: [Combining my RSS feeds using RSS-Bridge](/2024/01/combining-my-rss-feeds-using-rss-bridge)
