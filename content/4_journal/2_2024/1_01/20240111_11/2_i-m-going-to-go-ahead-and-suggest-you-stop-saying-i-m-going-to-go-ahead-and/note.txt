Title: I'm going to go ahead and suggest you stop saying "I'm going to go ahead and..."

Text: I have a suggestion for people making YouTube videos: Leave out the phrase "...go ahead and...". So, instead of, "I'm going to go ahead and launch the app now." you could say, "I'm going to launch the app now." Thanks.
