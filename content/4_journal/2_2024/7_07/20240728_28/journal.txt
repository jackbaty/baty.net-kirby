Arc Browser is better than Safari in many ways, but Safari is quieter, somehow, and most of the time that's what I prefer.

I decided to change how [jackbaty.com](https://jackbaty.com) is generated. It's no longer exported from an Org-mode file. It's now a Markdown file and I create the HTML via Pandoc. I also added Simple.css for some added purdiness.
