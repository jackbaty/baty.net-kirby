Title: Politics and communities

Text:

I'd love if [Dave would join](https://nice-marmot.net/Archives/2024/July_2024.html#note_2248) the new 500.social instance. He hesitates partly due to the guideline suggesting "Posts about politics and religion should be avoided". I understand, but disagree that "everything today is political". To me, it's more that today, politics are everywhere. Subtle difference, but still different :). I don't believe politics _must_ be everywhere. I have conversations all the time that are nothing to do with politics, and not all of them are "happy talk" in a bubble. There are all sorts of topics we can discuss, both comfortable and not. Dave's thoughtful and can be quite political on his site. No problem there (it helps that I usually agree with him üòÅ). It would be fun to have him join the discussions somewhere where things can be about something else. It might be a nice respite.

Update: [Dave responds](https://nice-marmot.net/Archives/2024/July_2024.html#note_2252). I love his reference to DFW's "This is Water" speech. It could be that I'm just not noticing when politics have entered the conversations. It depends on one's definition of "Politics". Dave frequently posts about political issues, so he probably recognizes political topics more easily. My vision is perhaps narrower, so I don't notice politics everywhere. We also might be thinking of "Community" differently. This has been a helpful discussion. Thanks Dave!
