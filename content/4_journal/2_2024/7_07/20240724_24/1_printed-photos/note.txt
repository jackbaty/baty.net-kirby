Title: Printed photos

----

Text: I keep finding that it doesn't matter to people how a photographic print was made. When I tell someone that I made a photo "by hand in my darkroom" they may give a subtle nod of approval, but that's about it. It's disappointing, considering that how a print was made is so meaningful to me, personally.
