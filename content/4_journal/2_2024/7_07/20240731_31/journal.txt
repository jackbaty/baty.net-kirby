I'm over-complicating things again. This blog, for one. Thinking about changing the home page to just a normal post...post...post format.

After a couple of days with [500.social](https://500.social) I'm wondering how useful "general interest" communities are to me. I love the _idea_, but in practice it's mostly a small group of people posting about anything and everything. I can get that anywhere, but more of it, right? Without at least some sort of unifying theme, I'm not sure what it's _for_, yet.
