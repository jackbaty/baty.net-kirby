Title: What if I didn't have "Posts"

----

Text: I prefer writing short, simple daily posts here in the Journal section of the blog. Longer posts have been in /posts, but those are becoming fewer and further between. I may combine everything into these daily notes and see how that goes. It would be nice not having to decide which goes where every time.
