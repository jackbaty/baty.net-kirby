üçø [The Bikeriders (2024)](https://baty.net/movies/the-bikeriders-2024)

I have an article due in a week, so this morning I thought I'd get at least an outline put together. I paused, then stopped, because I didn't know which app to use for writing it. Eventually I went with Emacs/Org-mode because that's where I'm comfortable, but the pause was telling and frustrating.

I married Gail 5 years ago today and I could not be happier. Best decision I ever made.
