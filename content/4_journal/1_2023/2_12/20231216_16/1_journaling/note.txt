Text: I've got a pretty sweet system for journaling in Emacs using (link: https://github.com/bastibe/org-journal/tree/master text: Org-journal). It's fast, free, plain text, and local first. I can export to a nice monthly two-column PDF using LaTeX and I'm happy with it. But once in a while I open Day One and my goodness that's a pleasant, easy app to use for Journaling. Plus, I can order cool printed books with just a few taps. I still use Tinderbox occasionally as a daybook, and I have a script there that cross-posts the current entry to Day One. Maybe I should recreate this for my Org journal. That way I don't have to decide üòÅ.
