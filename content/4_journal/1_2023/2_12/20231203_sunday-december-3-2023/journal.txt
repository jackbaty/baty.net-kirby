I'm trying to decide if I should continue to combine these journal posts with the "regular" posts in both the feed and other lists like on the (link: /@/page/ZWZVZSlNpA6VJzXZ text: Posts) page. I'd also like to split the daily journal into individual posts and combine them, like I do on (link: https://daily.baty.net text: daily.baty.net). That would require some work, but individual posts would be taggable and browsable, etc. Still noodling on that one.

How about we blame today's billionaires rather than yesterday's "boomers"?
