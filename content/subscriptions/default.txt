Subheadline: Things I pay for every month

Text:

I don't like subscriptions, but some things don't have either free or pay-and-keep options that are worth the trouble, so here we are.

I keep my list of subscriptions in an Org-mode file so I'll just copy and paste the table here. I'm sure I've missed a few. 

Not all of these are actually paid for monthly. Some I pay for annually, but have calculated the monthly costs here.
