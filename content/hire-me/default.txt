I co-founded a [successful digital studio](https://fusionary.com/) in 1995 and helped run it until we sold the company in 2020. I’ve been on a well-earned sabbatical since May, 2021.

**It’s time to get back to work.**

I am most comfortable in a digital project or product management role. I have extensive technical experience, so I enjoy working with engineering teams and helping them build things and solve problems. I’m good at managing digital products, understanding customer needs, and have led many large and small digital projects to successful completion.

I love communicating with customers about goals and requirements, followed by working with development teams to make those things happen. I’m a fanatic about usability. I take a pragmatic approach to product and project management, using the most useful components of agile methods.

I’ve lead teams working with companies like **Steelcase**, **GM**, **Major League Baseball**, **HealthcareSource**, and dozens more. All of them would recommend me as part of the team working on their projects.

I am honest, reliable, inventive, and fun to work with. I’m serious when I need to be.
