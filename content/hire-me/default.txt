Title: ✨ Hire Me

----

Text:

I co-founded a [successful digital studio](https://fusionary.com/) in 1995. We sold the company in 2020, and I’ve been on a well-earned sabbatical since May, 2021.

**It’s time to get back to work.**

I am most comfortable in a digital project or engineering management role. I have extensive technical experience, so I enjoy working with engineering teams and helping them build things and solve problems. I’m good at managing digital products, understanding customer needs, and have led many large and small digital projects to successful completion.

I love helping customers with goals and requirements, and then working with development teams to make those things happen. I’m a fanatic about usability. I take a pragmatic approach to development, using the most useful components of agile methods.

I’ve worked with companies like **Steelcase**, **GM**, **Major League Baseball**, **HealthcareSource**, and dozens more. All of them would recommend me as part of the team working on their projects.

I believe that project documentation and communication are paramount, and I can write documentation as well as communicate project goals, requirements, and progress.

I am honest, reliable, inventive, and fun to work with. I’m serious when I need to be.
