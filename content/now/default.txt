Here are a few things I'm doing or learning or playing with these days.

- Looking for my next thing. (psst [hire me](/hire-me))
- Reading "The Wager: A Tale of Shipwreck, Mutiny and Murder" by David Grann
- Reading "The Stranger" by Albert Camus
- Trying (and failing) to consolidate my blogs
- Photographing with the Leica M3 and Nikon F100
