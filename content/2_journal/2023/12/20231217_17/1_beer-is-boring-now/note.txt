Title: Beer is boring now

----

Text: Something I've realized about myself recently is that I no longer care about beer. I still love drinking beer, but I've settled on a couple of boring IPAs and otherwise stopped thinking about it. (Two Hearted and All Day with Zombie Dust thrown in if it's on tap). I no longer seek out special editions or try everything available. I'm not standing in lines outside of Founders or wherever. I just order a Two Hearted and enjoy my dinner.
