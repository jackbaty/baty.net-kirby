I've rejiggered the underpinnings of Kirby here, and it's probably going to be a mess for a while. Sorry for any troubles.

The short version is that I've tried replicating the system I had using Tinderbox over at (link: https://daily.baty.net text: daily.baty.net), which is that I create a daily journal note, then create individual notes "inside" it. This way each sub-post has it's own URL and detail page view. 

I *think* I've made URLs work the way I want them, but old daily notes have moved and will be broken. I hate this, but it's not worth the complexity it would require to fix it. I'm not great at Kirby, so maybe I'll find a solution later.

I have no idea what I'm going to do about the RSS feed, yet. Stick with me, I'm still noodlin'. Of course I could wait to deploy until I have it all worked out, but where's the fun in that? üòÅ
