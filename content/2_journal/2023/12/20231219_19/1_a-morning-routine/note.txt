Title: A morning routine

----

Text:

Here's the morning routine I've been working toward:

- Walk, 30 minutes with the dog
- Yoga, 20 minutes
- Meditate, 10 minutes
- Journal, 10-30 minutes

I feel like dedicating an hour or hour and a half each morning to the above is starting to pay back the investment. It's only been a couple of weeks, but I feel better. Calmer. More open to whatever the day might bring. I just need to make it a permanent habit once the novelty wears off.
