Project/product manager, developer, and founding partner at Fusionary Media (1995-2020). We sold the company in 2020 and I’m now looking for my next thing. I’m good at process (e.g. Agile), requirements, user experience, documentation, and product/project management. If there’s anything you think I could do for you, (link: page://oVmmR9h6SoeekkBJ text: hire me). I’ve been at this for a long time. I enjoy working with both clients and dev teams.

I love photography, writing, and tinkering with web technologies.
