Summary:

HER GAME. HER RULES.

Tennis player turned coach Tashi has taken her husband, Art, and transformed him into a world-famous Major champion. To jolt him out of his recent losing streak, she signs him up for a “Challenger” event — close to the lowest level of pro tournament — where he finds himself standing across the net from his former best friend and Tashi’s former boyfriend.

I disliked everyone. Stop moping. I like tennis, but not enough, I guess, because I didn't really care who won.

Zandaya is great, though.
