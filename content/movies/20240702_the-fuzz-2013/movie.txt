Summary:

MONEY. MURDER. JELLYBEANS.
When a string of violent, drug-related crimes rock the seedy Puppet Town neighborhood, Herbie, a puppet cop, must work together with his hapless human partner Sanchez to track down the dangerous puppet drug dealer Rainbow Brown, who will stop at nothing in becoming the most powerful criminal in the city.

Text: Making puppets do edgy, adult things isn't enough to justify an entire movie. It was fun for a half-hour, though.
