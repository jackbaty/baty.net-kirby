Summary:

LEGACIES DON’T COME EASY.

After a chance encounter at a local bar, strong-willed Kathy is inextricably drawn to Benny, the newest member of Midwestern motorcycle club, the Vandals led by the enigmatic Johnny. Much like the country around it, the club begins to evolve, transforming from a gathering place for local outsiders into a dangerous underworld of violence, forcing Benny to choose between Kathy and his loyalty to the club.

Text:

Someone said this had "...a cast that feels like the Avengers of sexy method weirdos" and that's about right. If this movie was a band it would be "Wannabe Tom Waits and the Accents."

I don't know if Comer's accent was good or not, but it was distracting and ruined every scene she was in.
