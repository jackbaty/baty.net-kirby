Title: PSA: A statement about Statements

----

Summary: Silence is not a Statement. That's why it's called "silence".

----

Text: There are many things that happen in the world about which I know little or nothing. It would be meaningless, useless, and potentially harmful for me to issue any sort of comment, let alone a capital-S Statement, about such things. So I don't. And no, silence is not a statement. That's why it's called "silence". Also, not saying something on social media does not indicate lack of action. In case anyone was wondering.
