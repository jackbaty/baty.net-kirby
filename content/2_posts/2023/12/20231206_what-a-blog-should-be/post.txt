There have been a flurry of recent posts around what one should write about or post on a personal blog. "What should a blog *be*?"

Robin, for example, writes "(link: https://robinrendle.com/notes/i-am-a-poem-i-am-not-software/ text: I am a poem I am not software)":

> Either way, the more boring personal websites I see the more I want to skip the boring corporate handshake at the beginning. Because youâ€™re more than a list of accomplishments, more than a career, more than a Wordpress template, or SQL query, more than one subject for a narrow audience.

Same. 

Thing is, I almost never worry about what goes here. It's just a stupid website. Who cares? 

I'm currently looking for work, so I probably should keep things tidy and professional and LinkedIn-ey and talk about how "Super Excited I am for this new journey" (ðŸ¤®), but I'm not going to do that. If a potential employer reads my blog, they'll either click with it or they won't. I hope they do ((link: /hire-me text: Hire me!)), but if they don't, it probably wasn't going to be a good fit anyway.

So yeah, I'm a poem.
