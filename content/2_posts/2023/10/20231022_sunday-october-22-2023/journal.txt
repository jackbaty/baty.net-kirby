This leaf stood out while I was walking Alice this morning, so I picked it up, brought it home, and dropped it on the flatbed scanner.

Here's something I find soothing: Closing my eyes and running my hands gently over the pages in my notebook and feeling the texture caused by the pressure of the pen while I wrote.

I tried doing that on my laptop screen and felt nothing.

One of the reasons I'd decided to write for the blog locally and rsync the content to production was that I intended to edit the content files directly using Emacs. I've not done that once, so editing via the Kirby panel on the live site is probably the way to go.

I hope it lasts, because I really like having only one website right now.
