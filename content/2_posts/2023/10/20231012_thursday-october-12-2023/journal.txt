Summary: My daughter had a baby boy today, making me a first-time grandfather. (link: page://IBGrpyTdC97AP2Ix text: Grandfatherhood).

I was wondering if it would be possible to grab each "block" in a post and render them as a separate RSS feed. This is how I had built the Daily Notes blog in Tinderbox. I assumed it was not trivial, but I've learned that one can easily loop through each block in a post and render them individually. I can think of a few fun ways to use that, one of which could be to render a separate RSS feed. Neat!

Two phrases I think we can be done with: "This is the way" and "Welcome to my TED talk."
