I've been thinking a lot about the cameras I use.

Specifically, I'm reconsidering the SL2. It's great and all, but I don't need it. It's big and heavy and meant for things I rarely actually do.

What if I were to consolidate around the M system? The idea is that I would sell the SL2 and Q2 and replace them with an M10-R or M11. I know, I've been down this path before. I start out all excited but then am reminded that the M10 is inconvenient as a daily carry camera. The Q2 is better suited for that, but it's not the same experience otherwise.Â 

What if, instead of a convenient-but-not-that-compact Q2, I took the GRIII out when I don't feel like carrying a real camera? The options would be either a bag with the M10 and MP or just the little GRIII. Maybe even just the iPhone.

Honestly, I'd probably end up with a Q2 again in 3 months, but I kind of want to try it. My heart has long belonged to Leica M cameras.

Oh, and I'm considering replacing the MP with a Rolleiflex. How fun would that be? I wouldn't actually sell the MP, since it's my forever camera, but I might sell the Hasselblad to fund a Rolleiflex. Then, instead of having two nearly identical cameras (one film, one digital) in my bag, I'd have a digital M and a fun, medium format film camera. This sounds neat to me. Still noodlin' on it.
