Summary: Changes to Kirby behavior, cover images, and the move back to my own server. Andreessen is horribly wrong.

I've removed all traces of "cover" images in Kirby for now. I find the reliance upon featured images to be too much pressure. Most implementations require an all-or-nothing approach. I tried something different, it didn't work, so I cut it.

After the frustration of failing to do something interesting in Kirby, I did spend some time yesterday considering a move back to Hugo. That felt a bit reactionary, so I calmed down and decided to just keep typing here. Going back to all textarea/markdown/kirbytext for both regular and journal posts reduced my twitchiness about storage formats and having to add conditionals everywhere, so that's something.

I kind of feel like just sort of freeform journaling here. Anything goes! We'll see. For example, I started adding blocking and subfloor in the bathroom this morning. Do you care? No. But here it is anyway.

I finally figured out my Kirby/Caddy/php-fpm issue so I've moved the site to my usual server. I'm worried there are some loose ends to tie up, but it's mostly working.

Marc Andreessen is totally and depressingly wrong.

Almost forgot, I added a "Reply by Email" link to the bottom of posts. Send me a note!
