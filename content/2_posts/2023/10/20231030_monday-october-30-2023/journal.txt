I'm so tired of thinking about organizing things. I enjoy a good organization scheme, but my tendency toward continually *re*-organize things is unhealthy.

The thing I dislike about Obsidian is that there are things like the [Obsidian Omnivore Plugin](https://docs.omnivore.app/integrations/obsidian.html) which make things so easy. It's difficult to ignore the idea of "just use Obsidian and be done with it, Jeez!"

I'm feeling twitchy about Kirby again. I can't put my finger on it. It's a combination of it not being a static site and also that I had to sort of roll my own, which means I'm alone over here when things break. Just a little twitchy about it, is all.

Well, (link: https://omnivore.app/ text: Omnivore) is completely hosed for me. Great.
