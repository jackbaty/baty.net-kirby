I am in the middle of converting the post format here from Kirby's "Blocks" to just the regular textarea/markdown. This meant changing templates, snippets, blueprints, collections, etc. Also, I had to convert the block content by hand. That was fun. I'm keeping these journal posts as Blocks for now, because I'm thinking about how I might use them differently than regular post content. I should decide soon because changing my mind with Kirby is non-trivial. Sorry about the broken cover images at the moment. I'm working on that now.
