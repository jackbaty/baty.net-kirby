I really like Kirby for running this blog. But, and we knew there would be a "but", it still feels like I'm "running software". Even though it's only PHP (no database, etc.), I miss the feeling with static blogs that I can just leave it over there on the server and it'll always be there. This is an over-simplification and not really accurate, but feelings can't be helped. I'm trying to get past it.

(link: https://fsnot.es/ text: FSNotes) looks like a nice take on notes. At first glance, it looks like a combination of NVAlt and Apple Notes/Bear. I like its use of Textbundles, since so many of my notes include images. Textbundles walk all over the way, say, Obsidian handles attachments. Ironically, I'll keep my notes about it (link: https://wiki.baty.net/#FSNotes text: in the wiki)

I find speculation about what a company (e.g. Apple) *might* do to be supremely uninteresting. I can wait.

I don't need video in my camera and I don't need AI in my notes.
