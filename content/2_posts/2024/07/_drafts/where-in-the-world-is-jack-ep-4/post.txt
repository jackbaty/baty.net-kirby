## No more giant walls of text

I am an advocate of "plain text" notes. Plain text is resilient, malleable, lightweight, and universal. It's also, well, plain.

Reading plain text notes often ends up feeling like I'm staring at a giant wall of text. It gets boring. Worse, it's not that _useful_.

When I'm feeling plain-text fatigue, I turn to tools that are more visual. My favorites are Tinderbox[^2], Curio[^1], and TheBrain[^3].

Each time I move to using a visual tool, I experience a sense of relief. Instead of using complex and arcane keyboard shortcuts to manipulate a wall of text (:cough:, Emacs), I can simply lean back in my chair and manage things with the mouse. One-handed computing is so pleasant!

So, the answer to "Where in the World is Jack?" this month is: **Curio**. In fact, I'm using it to manage writing this article.

Similar to Apple's new Freeform app, Curio is a "freeform notebook environment", but Curio is much more. It's furiously capable and powerful as a visual note-taking or project management tool. Curio has been around for more than 20 years, and its developer, George, remains friendly and responsive. It's a delightful bit of software.

It's amazing how, when coming back to an old project in Curio, I can open it and immediately get a sense for the shape of the project, no matter how old. As a fan of the visual tool, [Kinopio](https://kinopio.club/hello-kinopio-6mKA1LxTWWVdAcZgq1QA0), the author of this newsletter, probably knows what I mean.



So, right now, my projects are being managed in Curio. No more giant walls of text.
