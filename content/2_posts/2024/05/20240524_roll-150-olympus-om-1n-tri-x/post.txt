Here are a few from Roll-150 out of the Olympus OM-1n. This is Tri-X and I believe all of them were taken using the Zuiko 50mm f/1.4.

I used my new squeegee and hung this roll to dry in the shower rather than using the dryer. The squeegee caused no scratches (as The Internet scares one into worrying about) and there were no water spots. I also noticed very little dust, which I've been fighting with. The exception is the one of Lincoln. I have no idea what happened on the right side of that frame.
