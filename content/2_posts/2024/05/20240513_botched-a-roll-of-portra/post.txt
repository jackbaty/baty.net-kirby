I botched a roll of film while processing yesterday. After the pre-wash step, instead of emptying the water from the JOBO tank, I just poured the developer in with it. This of course diluted the developer. I thought it was odd that some of the dev ran out of the tank but kept going anyway and didn't realize what had happened until I poured the developer out and noticed there was way too much of it and the color was very diluted. I pressed on, just in case.

Fortunately, I at least got salvageable images. The roll of Portra had expired in 2014, so I wasn't expecting much to begin with. The colors are off and they look underexposed, but it's my mom, so I'm happy to have them.
