Title: Today's software installations

So far today, (as of 9:57 am) I have installed three apps that I had deliberately avoided installing on the new Mac Mini.

[MailMate](https://freron.com/) because I just quit Hey but still wanted something different to play with. I've used MailMate on and off since sometime in 2013 I think. It's a powerful, flexible, text/Markdown-first email app.

[TheBrain](https://thebrain.com) because I'm still looking for the "Everything" app, and in my experience, TheBrain has been the best at that. If I'd never stopped using it, I'd be able to find every single thing and everything associated with that thing.

[Bike Outliner](https://www.hogbaysoftware.com/bike/) because sometimes I just want a quick outline without all the fuss of Tinderbox or Org-mode. Bike is nice for that.
