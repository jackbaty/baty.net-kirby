[My new note-taking system: Don’t take notes. - Jack Baty](https://baty.blog/2021/my-new-note-taking-system-dont-take-notes/)

> No more Roam vs Obsidian vs Tinderbox vs Org mode vs The Archive or what-have-you until I stop obsessing over which is better or more private or more open source or if it uses the right kind of Markdown. No more worrying about whether I’m taking “smart” enough notes or if this one should be “evergreen” or not. How long should a zettel be, anyway?

I wrote that post in spring of 2021. I am having the same feelings again today. I'm tired of thinking about notes and tools and workflows. It's just a phase, but I may run with the Don't Take Notes plan for a bit and see how it feels. Or maybe I'll limit myself to paper notes. Those never confuse me or cause me stress. Sounds like a plan.
