The film had expired in 2013 but considering that I had no idea if the camera even worked, I wasn't worried about the film quality.\n\nI processed the roll and saw that, happily, there were images on the negative. Scanning revealed that the images were less than stellar, though. I had accidentally made two double exposures, since the film needs to be manually advanced and there's nothing stopping the shutter from firing when you forget."},"id":"e6b4fa91-2689-47d5-90f1-a582ea3a10bf","isHidden":false,"type":"markdown"},{"content":{"location":"kirby","image":["file://vAtw7B1FLxrIpNNv"],"src":"","alt":"","caption":"My wife didn't know about advancing the shutter when she took this.
