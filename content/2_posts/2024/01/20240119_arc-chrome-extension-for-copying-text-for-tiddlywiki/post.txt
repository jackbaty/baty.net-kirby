Title: Arc (Chrome) extension for copying text for TiddlyWiki

----

Summary:

Text:

I used to (link: https://wiki.baty.net/#Bookmarklet%20for%20quoting%20to%20TiddlyWiki text: have a bookmarklet) that would take selected text on a web page and generate a quoted block and link in markup suitable for use in TiddlyWiki.

Arc Browser doesn't support bookmarklets for some strange reason, so I (finally) converted my bookmarklet to a Chrome extension using [this tool](https://sandbox.self.li/bookmarklet-to-extension/).

I put a zipped copy here:

(file: copy-quoted-text-for-tiddlywiki.zip)

Unzip it, click the "Load unpacked" button on Arc/Chrome's Extensions page and select the folder. No guarantees that it'll work for you, but you're welcome to it.
