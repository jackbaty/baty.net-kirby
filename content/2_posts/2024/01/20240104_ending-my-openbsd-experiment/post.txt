I did (link: /journal/2023/12/29/running-an-openbsd-server text: this fun thing) from Derek Sivers because I wanted to play with [OpenBSD](https://www.openbsdfoundation.org) and with [Vultr](https://www.vultr.com/) for hosting.

Well, I played with it. It was fun. I got to see how [Dovecot](https://dovecot.org/) works and I learned how to configure Relayd and the OpenBSD httpd server.

I think I'd end up liking it. BSD feels lighter and simpler and therefore probably more secure than the Ubuntu servers I'm running. 

However, I don't need another server to manage. I don't need to run my own mail server or CalDAV server. My VPS at Digital Ocean has been running (::knocks wood::) smoothly for years and I've got the configuration down. 

I'll be deleting the OpenBSD server once I've moved the few sites I'd migrated there back to Digital Ocean.
