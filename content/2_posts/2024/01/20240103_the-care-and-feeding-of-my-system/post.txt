Title: The care and feeding of my system

Yesterday, for some reason, the menu bar stopped showing when launching Emacs. Good grief. I had to add an explicit call to `(menu-bar-mode)` in my init.el. Why? Who knows. I'm sure I did something to cause it, but my commit logs don't point to anything obvious. 

It's another one of those mysteries, I guess ¯\_(ツ)_/¯. 

Thing is, I'm weary of mystery. I want things to work all the time and require as little fuss as possible. My current situation requires a lot of care and feeding and I need to find a way out of it.

I'm not blaming Emacs, specifically, although Emacs is frequently the day's scapegoat. Yesterday I was testing the waters of moving my Daybook back to Tinderbox. I copied last year's file and cleaned out the existing entries. Then, when I'd add a weight log entry in the new file, the entry would disappear a few seconds later. That's fun. I think I figured out why it was happening, but it took me thirty minutes. How much of my life is wasted on these thirty-minute (or longer) interruptions while I fix or tweak something that didn't need fixing or tweaking yesterday?

Sure, much of this is self-imposed because I tweak. But I'm beginning to tire of *having* to babysit the things that should just be basic infrastructure. I caused this, and it's my problem to fix, but I'm still thinking through what that looks like.
