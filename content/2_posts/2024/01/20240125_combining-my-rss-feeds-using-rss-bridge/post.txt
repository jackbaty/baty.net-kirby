Summary: <p>I have several sites with individual RSS feeds. Here's how I combined them.</p>

There's this dream I have in which I've combined all of my websites into a single place where I post everything. It's glorious. Then, I wake up and remember the mess of sites I've scattered far and wide. 

I'm learning the painful lesson that I have so much fun trying new tools and platforms that I'll never be content putting everything into just one of them. So, I continue tinkering with my (link: https://baty.net text: blog) and my (link: https://wiki.baty.net text: wiki) and my (link: https://baty.blog text: other blog) and my (link: https://daily.baty.net text: other other blog).

Each of them has their own RSS feed.

There are a few people who, oddly, follow several or all of them. For those who might be interested in keeping track of everything I post, I've been looking for a way to generate an aggregate RSS feed.

At one point I used WordPress and some plugins for this, but I'd rather not *have* to run WordPress and the plugins were expensive if I wanted specific behaviors.

There are a few services for this, rss.app, RSS Hub, but they're all either expensive or not what I'm looking for.

I initially skipped [RSS-Bridge](https://rss-bridge.org/) because I didn't think it did what I needed. I received a nudge in that direction from [Christian Tietze](https://social.lol/@ctietze@mastodon.social) and he was right. It does what I'm looking for.

The short version is that I dropped a bunch of PHP files (RSS-Bridge) onto my server and did some copy/paste/edit hacking to create a new "bridge" and now I have a combined feed. ([here's the new bridge](https://gist.github.com/jackbaty/aaba9bbadec4753f927e554cbaa5d381))

Since the URL for the combined feed is clunky, I'm redirecting from this URL: https://baty.net/everything.rss. That way I can move things around without breaking the link. I hope.

I'm not getting too attached to this yet, since I've only been running my instance of RSS-Bridge for a few hours and who knows what kind of unintended consequences there will be. But it will be cool if it works out.
