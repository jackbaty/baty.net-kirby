Title: Fending off the Futz Monkey

Summary: <p>When is trying to avoid futzing actually just more futzing?</p>

Mike Hall resonates with me again with a [post about futzing with stuff](https://mike.puddingtime.org/posts/2024-02-19-daily-notes/). It's like he's in my head when he writes about "keeping the futz monkey off my back."

I'm in my version of a similar place. For example, yesterday I posted to three different websites. Each of them managed using different and unconventional software. There's [Tinderbox](https://eastgate.com/Tinderbox), [TiddlyWiki](https://tiddlywiki.com), and [Kirby CMS](https://getkirby.com/). They all depend on a pile of custom templates, scripts, and sloppily-documented setup. They work, but what if they don't? I'm not always in the mood for futzing with them.

Those three sites are run on two different servers. One Ubuntu, one OpenBSD. I had this idea of moving all of my stuff to the OpenBSD instance, but I spent hours trying to get Kirby/PHP running under the built-in httpd server and failed. Caddy is so much simpler, and I'm familiar with it, so I'm *this* close to dumping the BSD box and pulling everything back to Ubuntu. 

Always choosing the clever option makes for so much extra work. Too much.

Speaking of clever, Emacs and Org-mode are clever. Maybe too clever for my own good. I probably spend three or four hours a week futzing with my Emacs setup. It's fun, though, right? Yes, it's fun, but it's also unnecessary. I mean, it's notes, right? I could use *anything* for that, but I've chosen the clever option again.

The draw of Emacs is that I have convinced myself that since I can do nearly everything in Emacs, the time spent making it look and act just the way I like it is worth the effort. Maybe it is, but it's still a lot of time spent.

It's not Emacs' fault. I could move everything to Obsidian and then I'd just futz with that instead. Probably. But maybe not. I don't know. Sometimes I switch tools because I've convinced myself that I'm actually simplifying things. This is a convenient lie. On the other hand, the Futz Factor of even something as tweakable as Obsidian is lower than that of Emacs, so I try it every few months. It doesn't last, even though Obsidian is probably the correct answer. Or it would be if I actually enjoyed using it.

Ideally, I'd use tools with the lowest possible futz factor, but the futz monkey is a sneaky bastard, so the best I can hope for is something with just the right amount.

Right now I don't have the energy for maintaining multiple blogs. I don't have the energy to figure out why <kbd><kbd>CTRL</kbd>-<kbd>e</kbd></kbd> doesn't do what it's supposed to in Emacs. I don't feel like running servers with different operating systems and web servers. I don't feel like futzing.

So you'll probably see me writing on this blog at baty.net and putting notes about stuff into [the wiki](https://wiki.baty.net). I'll probably move the sites I've put on OpenBSD back to the Ubuntu server. I may even fire up Obsidian again. That may sound a lot like futzing, but I've convinced myself that it's the best way to *avoid* futzing. Take that, you stupid monkey!
