Title: A short break from social media

I am backing away from social media for a bit. I posted the following on Mastodon:

> I need to step away for a bit. I'll be back in a day or a month, but I need a break. I'd like to spend some time with my own thoughts. (Not that there's anything wrong with yours ðŸ˜€). I'll always be at baty.net if you need me.

I've watched myself just scrolling and clicking random shit for the better part of the past few days (weeks, actually) and, other than some minor entertainment, I've gotten little from it. That's not true, I get quite a lot out of it. I discover photographers, developers, philosophers, artists, and really detailed nerds who teach me how to do the most nerdy things. 

I love social media, but at some point it becomes about filling my head with other people's thoughts rather than doing stuff with my own. And a lot of other people's thoughts are along the lines of pointing and yelling, "That's Bad!", which I find exhausting and depressing.

Spending some time in my own head is probably good for me, even though I don't always enjoy being there. (Hence the reason I spend so much time online).

See you in a while. In the meantime, you can always [email me](mailto:jack@baty.net). I love getting email.
