It lasted almost a month. Using Ghost for baty.net, I mean. I was excited about it and looking forward to just typing and hitting "Publish" and not worrying about templates and hosting and tweaks. I found a very nice (and expensive) theme and was off and running.

Except I was still self-hosting on a new server. And I was still tweaking the theme's templates. The theme was expensive. I wasn't just typing and hitting "Publish"  like I expected.

Sure, I had access to the theme's templates, and I could do with them whatever I wanted, but I've never been comfortable tweaking Ghost themes. Although the theme I chose looks great, it felt like it belonged to someone else. It didn't fit my vibe, if you know what I mean.

So, I've installed a fresh copy of PHP on the new Hetzner VPS, configured Caddy to run Kirby, copied my site there, pointed DNS at it, and viola! Here we are.

I apologize for what's sure to be some noise in the RSS feeds.
