Most of the information I've written down about my cameras is either on myÂ [wiki](https://wiki.baty.net/)Â or in random blog posts. I've decided to try and consolidate things in a new, separate wiki (usingÂ [TiddlyWiki](https://tiddlywiki.com/)). It was trivial to drag and drop my original camera notes from the main wiki into this new wiki. I then copied the wiki file to my server, and it now lives here:

**ðŸ‘‰**Â [**jackbaty.com/cameras**](https://jackbaty.com/cameras)

It's very much a work-in-progress. My intention is to flesh out the individual entries and catch up on the TODO list. If that goes well, I may include some of my photos or notes on process. After that, maybe I'll add information about photographers who've inspired me. Or not, who knows? TiddlyWiki makes all this easy, but it is also kind of weird. I'll try to keep it easy as I can to navigate.
