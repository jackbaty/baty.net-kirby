Hooboy, do I know that feeling. Every Sunday I run MacUpdater. It updated 12 apps this morning. That's 12 updates in the last week. There's a little summary at the bottom. Today, mine reads:

> Info: found 144 apps in total, 43 are ignored and 0 are hidden away. Displaying 101 apps, 100 are up-to-date and 1 have updates available.

Cool. Cool.

Yesterday, the (link: https://setapp.com text: SetApp) folks acknowledged my addiction by sending me this:

There are days when I convince myself I could live in a web browser, Emacs, a terminal, and a file manager. And I could probably do that, but there's too much good software out there and I love playing with all of it. The hoarding shall continue.
