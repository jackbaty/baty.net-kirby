Youâ€™ll notice that baty.net is back to using Hugo[^1]. I really like Kirby, but every time I use a platform thatâ€™s not fully static, I get twitchy, and I got twitchy.

Iâ€™m using a new theme,Â [Anubis2](https://github.com/Junyi-99/hugo-theme-anubis2), which I find to be easy to read and just the right amount of boring. It doesnâ€™t have all the features of the PaperMod theme I was using, but itâ€™s simpler, and simpler is what I was after.

I copied over all of the originalÂ [Journal posts](http://localhost:1313/journal/), but I donâ€™t know if Iâ€™ll continue to treat those separately. Iâ€™m kind of digging howÂ [everything is just a post](http://localhost:1313/posts/2025/02/when-everything-is-a-post/)Â here. Weâ€™ll see.

For years, Iâ€™ve been dragging around old broken images and image folders from various platforms, so I took the opportunity to fix as many of those as I could find. That was tedious, but felt good.

It was refreshing posting at copingmechanism.com for a few days, without years of baggage tagging along. In the end, though, baty.net is my home on the web. Itâ€™s established. (A few) people know it and follow it. Better not to throw it all out on a whim, just because I was uneasy about it not being fully static.

Anyway, weâ€™re back. ðŸ‘‹


[^1]: For those keeping score, I was with Kirby for 34 days.
