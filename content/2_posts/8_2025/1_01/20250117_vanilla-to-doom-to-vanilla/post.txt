I'd been happily using Doom Emacs until just over a month ago, when I decided to [start from scratch again](https://baty.net/posts/2024/12/emacs-from-scratch-once-again). 

It didn't take long before I started missing some of the niceties of Doom. I'm faster when using Doom/Evil, and sometimes it's good having things taken care of for me.

So, at the beginning of January, I switched back to Doom.

After a week using Doom, I was feeling pretty comfy. Too comfy, in fact. I couldn't shake the feeling that every Doom keybinding I internalized brought me closer to *depending* on Doom. It made me twitchy. Every time I typed something like `SPC m a a` or put a Doom macro like `after!` or `map!` in my configuration, I felt like I was spending time learning *someone else's tool*.

So, this morning I switched back to my vanilla config.

Now I feel better. I'm a little clumsier, and sometimes I wish I didn't have to do *everything*, but dammit it's MINE! ðŸ˜„.
