While tinkering with Obsidian recently, something I liked was having a daily notes template with a Dataview query showing the other files I’d added that same day. I added something similar for Denote. It’s a Yasnippet:

```
    # -*- mode: snippet -*-
    # name: Denote insert today's links
    # key: dnl
    # --
    
    #+begin: denote-links :regexp "^`(format-time-string "%Y%m%d")`$0"
    #+end
```    

I just run that after first creating the daily note and I get a list of links to the other Denote files from that day. There’s probably a way to automate that, but this is good enough for who it’s for.
