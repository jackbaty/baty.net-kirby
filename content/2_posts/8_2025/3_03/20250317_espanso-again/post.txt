I’ve gone back to using [Espanso](https://espanso.org/) for text expansion. As powerful as Keyboard Maestro is, every time I reach for it I feel like I’ve already lost a battle somewhere. Text expansion macros are about all I use KM for these days, so it’s not much of a disruption.

I bookmark Espanso’s config folder in Emacs so I can jump right in any time. The expansion macros (“matches”) are contained in YAML files and can be as simple as:

```yaml
- trigger: "j@"
  replace: "jack@baty.net
```    

They can get pretty fancy. I don’t take full advantage of all the gizmos, but I use a ton of stuff like this:

```yaml
- trigger: ":hugo"
	label: "Baty.net Hugo Post"
	vars:
	  - name: mydate
		type: date
		params:
		  format: "%Y-%m-%d"
	  - name: mytime
		type: date
		params:
		  format: "%H:%M:%S%:z"
	replace: |
