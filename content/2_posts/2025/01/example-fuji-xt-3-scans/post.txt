I only scanned a few rolls using the Fuji XT-3, and most were just test rolls taking while messing around my house. I don't have any examples that really demonstrate the results, but here are a few scans that I could find.

Low-res versions:

Here's a zip of the original scans (converted to JPG): (file: samples-xt3.zip)

Hope this helps.

Honestly, I never got on with scanning with digital cameras, so I'm back to using an Epson V850 flatbed with SilverFast. The new SilverFast has a quick-scan feature that speeds things up quite a bit. I never really perfected the digital scan process.
