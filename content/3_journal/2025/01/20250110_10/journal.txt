My dog has had a few instances where (we think) she throws her back out. All of a sudden she'll struggle on stairs and will be in obvious discomfort. Last time was about a month ago, and it lasted a few days. We gave her doggy ibuprofen and muscle relaxers. This happened again on Wednesday evening. I can't stand it when she's suffering. She slept all night last night. No shaking or panting. She navigated the stairs and didn't hesitate during our walk this morning, so I'm hoping she's on the mend again.

Well, my Capture One subscription renewed this morning. I hope I use it.

I got my Doom Emacs config caught up with the latest changes to my from-scratch config yesterday. I hate admitting how good Doom is, because it makes me feel like I've wasted my time writing my own config.

Oooh, my CLA'd (by John Hermanson) OM-1n and OM-2n and lenses are out for delivery so will be back home today. Maybe this will entice me to take some photos, which I've not been doing, recently.
