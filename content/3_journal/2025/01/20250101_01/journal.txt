Hello, 2025, I guess?

I'd rather not start the year on a sour note, but I am no further along any path than I was a year ago. I still don't know where to put things. I still don't know what to use to manage my photos. I still don't know whether to use one or multiple notebooks...or whether to use paper notebooks at all. I still don't know which camera to bring with me. I decide about something every morning, then change my mind by the end of the day. Then I do the same thing the next day. Over and over. It's crazy-making.

A person can be right about some things and wrong about other things. I feel like we forget this too often.
