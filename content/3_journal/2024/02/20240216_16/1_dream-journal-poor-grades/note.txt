Title: Dream journal: Poor grades

----

Text: In my dream this morning, I was in a crowded room and was waiting to receive the grades for two papers I had written. I was pretty sure I'd aced both of them, but when handed to me, I saw that the long one was covered with red ink and graded "D" (actually it was "D^" because I guess I needed to be reminded it was a dream) and the other one was just as covered with red ink, but graded a "C". I couldn't understand how I could have been so wrong about what I thought I knew. It's still bothering me because it reflects how I feel about a lot of things in real life.
