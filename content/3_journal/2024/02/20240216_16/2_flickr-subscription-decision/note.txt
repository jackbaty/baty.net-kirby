Title: Flickr subscription decision

----

Text:

My Flickr Pro subscription, which I've maintained since there was such a thing, renews on March 15th for $73. For the first time ever, I'm thinking I might not renew it. I've been on Flickr since 2004. I still prefer it as a place to put photos. The problem, I guess, is that it's no longer the popular place to share photos (hasn't been for a while) and it's also stagnated in recent years. I was all fired up when SmugMug bought them, but what's happened since then? Nothing much that I can see.

I'll probably renew, just because of our history together. I've got thousands of photos spanning decades on the service. It would be a shame to give that all up now, just to save a few bucks. Still, it's a new and unnerving thing to think about.
