Title: All of the options are too many options

Text:

Pulling up a chair at the computer this morning, I looked at all of the wonderful blogging options available to me and decided there are too many of them. Now what? 

I love this stuff. My favorite pastime is to play with different ways of making words show up on the internet. Sometimes, today for example, I just want their to be One True Wayâ„¢. I want to know where to go to post something. I want to know how to do it. I want to know what to change if I don't like something.

This week has been an experiment in using *everything* all the time. It has been a blast, but I'm exhausted.

So for the rest of the day I think I'll close everything but the Kirby control panel and reduce my options to one.
