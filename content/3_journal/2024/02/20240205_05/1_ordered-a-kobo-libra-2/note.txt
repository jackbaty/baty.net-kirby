Title: Ordered a Kobo Libra 2

----

Text:

I have a first and second-generation Kindle Oasis, a Kobo Forma, and I prefer reading paper books, so of course I've ordered a (link: https://us.kobobooks.com/collections/ereaders/products/kobo-libra-2 text: Kobo Libra 2). 

But why? It started when I plugged the Forma into my Mac and clicked the "Send to Device" button on an ePub book in Calibre. I have a lot of ePub books Kobos handle them well. It also reminded me that Kobo hooks directly into my library via Libby, so I can rent books right from the device. That's handy. The Forma has an 8" screen, which I find too big (don't ask) and the Libra 2 has a 7" screen.

If those reasons aren't enough, I'll share with you what pushed me over the edge: USB-C. I dislike Micro-usb so much that I pad $180 so I'm not forced to use it.
