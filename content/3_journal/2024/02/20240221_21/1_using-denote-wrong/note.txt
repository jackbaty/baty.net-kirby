Title: Using Denote wrong?

----

Text: I feel like I've been using [Denote](https://protesilaos.com/emacs/denote) wrong. Denote has a very specific and enforced file naming format. What this should mean is that I can easily find and open my notes based on this format. I don't do that, though. I use `consult-notes` and search by title. I hardly ever even see the filename. Now, I can also use the finder or whatever to browse my notes, but I rarely do that. Is this weird?
