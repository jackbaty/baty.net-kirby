Text:

Wearisome: People getting hammered on social media for even suggesting that something might not be as automatically evil as everyone assumes it is. Or, more likely, as they heard someone say that it is.

I'm more of a "Trust but verify" sort. I also tend to give people the benefit of the doubt, even when they don't deserve it. The world is better this way.
