Text: I logged into Instagram for the first time in months today. I only follow photographers and photography-adjacent accounts. And still, it was a depressing slog through desperate grabs for attention, breathy accolades aimed at popular accounts (a different way of grabbing attention), and self-promotion. I hated it.
