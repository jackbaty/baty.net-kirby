Title: I kind of want a Stream Deck

Text: Well shoot, [Dave bought one](https://nice-marmot.net/Archives/2024/May_2024.html#note_2107), now I want a [Stream Deck](https://www.elgato.com/us/en/p/stream-deck-neo). $99 is under my threshold for not buying on impulse, so I don't know why I don't already have one. I don't even know what I'd use it for, but it sure looks fun to tinker with.
