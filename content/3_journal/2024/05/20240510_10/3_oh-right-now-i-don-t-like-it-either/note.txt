Title: Oh right, now I don't like it either

Text:

Two days ago: "I admit, when I first saw the ad, I thought it was fine. Not great, but I got what they were trying to say. I didn't give it a second thought."

Then: ::murmuring and grumbling by a handful of Important People::

Today: "Oh right, now that you mention it, I actually found the ad pretty offensive! How dare they do something so stupid and tone-deaf, right!? Here, let me write 5,000 words about why I (suddenly) thought it was such a terrible idea from the very beginning!"
