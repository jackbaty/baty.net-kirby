Upgraded Kirby to [4.2.0](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/releases/tag/4.2.0). It's telling that when I saw an update to Kirby I thought, "Well crap, I don't feel like upgrading." Even though upgrading is pretty simple, I worry that something will break and I'll be spending my day dealing with it. So far, upgrades have been flawless, so I should relax.

But I'm having one of those days.
