Title: Moods II

----

Text:

I started this morning in a pointy-clicky mood. So much so, that I "settled" on Obsidian for today's notes. It's now 1:00pm and I've reverted to "Emacs is better for my life" so I copied what I'd written today over from Obsidian to Emacs and that's a relief. I need to remember how it always goes:

Step 1 (6:00am): "Oh, wow, Obsidian is so much easier. I should use it for everything"

Step 2 (1:00pm): "I almost forgot that Emacs is so much *better* at nearly everything. Forget about Obsidian!"
