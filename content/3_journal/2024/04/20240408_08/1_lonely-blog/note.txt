Title: Lonely blog

Text: You know, for having decided at one point that baty.net was to be my One True Blogâ„¢ I sure have been *not* doing that. Today feels like a good day to exercise all of my blogs, if only to blow the dust out. Remember, [everything.rss](https://baty.net/everything.rss) is an RSS feed which combines all my blogs into one feed. If you're so inclined.
