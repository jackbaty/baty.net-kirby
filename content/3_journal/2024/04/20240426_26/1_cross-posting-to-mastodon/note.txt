Text: I'm testing something. Every post from here (as well as my other sites) are to be cross-posted to a new Mastodon account I set up just for this purpose. [@batybot](https://mastodon.social/@batybot). Cross-posting is handled via [EchoFeed](https://echofeed.app). If you're reading this on Mastodon, it worked.
