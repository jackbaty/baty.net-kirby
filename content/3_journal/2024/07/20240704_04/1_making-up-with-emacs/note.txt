Title: Making up with Emacs

----

Text:

Leaving Emacs is something I frequently consider, and occasionally try. 

I got mad at Emacs last weekend and swore off it, once and for all... again. Things that I need to always work stopped working for no reason I could fathom. That's not how I want to live, so I quit in a huff.

After exploring Evernote this week, I was reminded that I kind of don't want to go without Emacs for any length of time. I spent time today fixing what I could. It might be enough. We're getting along again.
