ðŸ‘‰ [Who am I responsible to here? - Jack Baty Daily](https://daily.baty.net/posts/2024/07/17/Who-am-I-responsible-to-.html)

It's so weird. I wake up, walk the dog, make coffee, journal, then sit at the computer and plan to fire up all my old blogs, just because. Then, I spend an hour in the darkroom, come back, and feel like just staying here in Kirby. It's like I'm a different person throughout each day. I'm either crazy, or a polymath.
