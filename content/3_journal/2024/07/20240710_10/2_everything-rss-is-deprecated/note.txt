Title: Everything.rss is deprecated

Text: I am shutting down the Digital Ocean instance running RSSBridge, and I don't want to move or maintain it, which means https://baty.net/everything.rss will no longer contain aggregated RSS feeds for my sites. I'm redirecting to the Baty.net main feed. Sorry for the disruption.
