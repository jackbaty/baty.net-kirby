Title: Emacs vs and or SilverBullet

----

Text: You know what's weird? I've spent a couple hours today cleaning my Emacs init.el file and re-writing my [notmuch](https://notmuchmail.org) config (I'm switching back from Mu4e). That's not the weird part. The weird part is that nearly everything else I've typed today has been in a browser window via [SilverBullet](https://silverbullet.md).
