üçø [The Fuzz](https://baty.net/movies/the-fuzz-2013) ‚òÖ‚òÖ

Farted around with Kirby again this morning. I fixed the og:image and og:description metadata. Improved the layout of [movie](/movies) pages. This is the fun and useful sort of futzing that I don't mind doing.

I saw that [Supacel](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/supacell) was seeing 100% on Rotten Tomatoes. Should be worth a look, even though I said I was done with anything superhero related. I should have listened. I simply don't care about superhero stories anymore.

Emacs made me so mad on Monday that I've not launched it since.
