Title: Monday

----

Text: It's Monday. This morning I'm going with a simple setup. Emacs, Finder, Terminal, and Safari. Those are not the _only_ apps I'll use, but that's where I'm going to try focusing my attention. Also, I'm blogging here at baty.net with Kirby. I spent some time over the weekend with my other blogs. I love them, but need to Reduce & Simplify a bit. So, good morning!
