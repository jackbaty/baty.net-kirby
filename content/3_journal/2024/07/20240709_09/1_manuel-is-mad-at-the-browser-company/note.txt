> Anyway, leaving aside the pointlessness of this whole thing what prompted me to write this post were some of the things the CEO said in the video explainer which are so profoundly stupid that I find them offensive. If you are an ARC user you should be offended too because he must think youâ€™re all a bunch of idiots.

I also find some of the things TBC does to be silly, but I love using Arc, and they would need to literally start stomping bunnies for me to stop. I find Manuel's post to be a bit over-reactive, personally, but I understand the gist.
