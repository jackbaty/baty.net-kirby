Posted using Tinderbox, Blot, TiddlyWiki, and now Kirby. All today. Cool

My sites were down for a while this morning. I'd done some server updates and restarted. Caddy didn't start automatically because for some reason Apache was already started. I don't remember installing Apache so ¯\_(ツ)_/¯. Anyway, disabled Apache and started Caddy.
