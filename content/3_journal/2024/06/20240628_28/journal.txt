I took a digital camera (Ricoh GRIII) on my walk yesterday. I was feeling lazy and the GRIII is tiny, easy, and makes great images. I don't know yet if this is the start of a digital phase, but I've been shopping for new cameras.

Not one second of the "debate" passed my eyes or ears last night. I was expecting to see my social media timeline filled with obnoxious gloating this morning, but instead I'm getting quiet, fearful, dejected tones. Shit.

I've deleted my Ghost instance on PikaPods. I guess that settles that for now, then.

The Supreme Court continues to lay the groundwork for a world I want no part of.
