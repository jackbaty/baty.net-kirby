Here we are again, in Kirby. Sorry for any disturbance.

(link: https://baty.net/movies/furiosa-a-mad-max-saga-2024 text: Watched Furiosa) last night and when I told my daughter she should watch it she said, "I saw the other one and it was just a bunch of mumbo jumbo on a moving vehicle." I give up :).

So, I'm editing this journal entry on the server via an Emacs Tramp session. I swore I wouldn't bother with doing that, but here we are.

I experienced a bit of what I'm calling "Leica Guilt" recently. Walking the pier in Grand Haven, I heard someone say "Leica" a few times as people passed. I'll write a bit more later, but it bothered me.
