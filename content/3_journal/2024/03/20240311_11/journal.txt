Oscars hot take: Christopher Nolan is not the "premier director of his generation." Both Yorgos Lanthimos and Denis Villeneuve make better films.

Someone noticed that a few links from my old substack were coming up 404. I moved those posts over here, and then started bringing other stuff over from the old sites at v13.baty.net and baty.blog. I soon realized it was going to take hours to finish, so I stopped. I suppose at some point I should migrate or consolidate everything published later than the [2020 archives](https://archive.baty.net) but right now I don't feel like it.

I have a profoundly negative reaction to the word "colorway". Just say "colors".

[Dave noticed](https://nice-marmot.net/Archives/2024/March_2024.html#note_1901) that I forgot to change the time when updating the date on a recent post. Fixed. (thanks Dave!)
