Title: Hitting the bricks again

----

Text: I've been dragging my feet on the job search. The role I've been hoping for has stalled and apparently they're rejiggering the position so it'll be weeks before it's reposted. This means I should hit the bricks again in the meantime. Someone out there wants to hire a 60-ish former developer/product manager/small business owner, right? [Right](/hire-me)!?
