I'm kind of bored with the internet. As I read through my RSS feeds and Mastodon just now, I felt myself shrugging or rolling my eyes at everything. This has been happening a lot lately and is definitely a Me problem, but it still ruins my time online. I get it, the climate is going to kill us all, blogs are cool again, Biden is old, Apple something something, someone did something problematic and we should all hate them, AI is the devil, AI is Jesus, and so on. It's boring.

I took just 3 days off social media last week and it was nice, but boring. How can I learn to not be bored while also not being on social media?
