Upgraded Kirby to 4.1.2. Bug fixes, mostly.

I really don't want to talk about tools anymore, but that's all I know how to talk about. Should I tell you how I've been forcing myself to use Obsidian again? I can't seem to stop trying.

Speaking of my websites (huh?), I'm increasingly uncomfortable with having content in Kirby's format. I want "normal" front matter. You know, like Blot handles properly. Uh oh.
