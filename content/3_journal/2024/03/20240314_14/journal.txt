I'm impossible. I've been posting daily notes over on [daily.baty.net](https://daily.baty.net) for a couple of days, after swearing that I was going to focus my attention here. Sometimes I convince myself that this is just me playing with stuff, but I can't describe how frustrating I get with this whole enterprise. Why can't I just have a blog like everyone else?

I've added the "Reply by Email" link to individual RSS feed items. (h/t [Dave Rogers](https://nice-marmot.net/Archives/2024/March_2024.html#note_1911))

Joy, now the baty.net/feed doesn't validate and the changes I've made to the template don't show up. Caching? Who knows. I don't feel like looking into it right now.
