This quote is in the [Huffington Post Article](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/gen-z-do-not-disturb_l_65eb41c7e4b05ec1ccd9c350) about Gen Z and phones:

> Calling someone on their cellphone when you aren't in a life or death situation  is disrespectful af. Like, what makes you think you're entitled to my attention right that moment, making me use up a hand to hold my phone
>

(boomer grumbles): Just get off TikTok for like 2 seconds and answer the phone, you baby. "Attention," my butt.
