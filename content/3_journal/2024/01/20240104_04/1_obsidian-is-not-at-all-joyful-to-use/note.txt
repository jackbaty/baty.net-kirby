Title: Obsidian is not at all joyful to use

Text: I spent some time in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) again yesterday. I do this once a month or so just to see if somehow it's changed into something I'd like to use. Obsidian is great software, in theory, but I still find it boring and unpleasant to actually use.
