Title: Non-plain-text guilt

----

Text: Accompanying my rash of plain-text shinanigans this week is a nagging unease about using Kirby for the website. Sure Kirby uses text files as data, but there's all that PHP and whatnot needed to actually *render* stuff. I kind of like the fire-and-forget feeling of a truly plain-text static website. Just noting the feeling here.
