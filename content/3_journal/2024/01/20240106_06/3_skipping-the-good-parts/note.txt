Title: Skipping the good parts

----

Text: Something I've noticed about myself recently is that I often skip the parts of TV shows and movies where people are fighting. I hit the Skip button until I get to the part where someone "wins" and go from there. I don't do this in movies like, say, John Wick, but in your run-of-the-mill thriller or Marvel movie, the fights are the boring parts. Hell, I skip past a lot of the set pieces, too. I suppose that in my old age, I'm less interested in the "action" portion of action movies.
