Have you ever been so enamoured with plain-text-static-html publishing that youâ€™re willing to burn down a month of implementing a blog using Kirby CMS in order to go back to using Emacs and Markdown and Hugo? I nearly did that today. Close call, but it's still idling in the back of my head, so no promises.

The problem I have is that once I get a system to a stable place, I want to change to a new system.
