Yesterday I was convinced that I should keep tasks out of Org-mode and use OmniFocus instead. I need my todos on mobile right? Now I'm not sure. I need reminders on mobile, but not my giant todo list. I'll need to figure this out, today.

On the (link: /journal text: Journal) page, I'm now showing a list of the notes created on that day in addition to any post text. Hoping this helps keep stuff from getting buried.
