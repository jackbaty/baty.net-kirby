Title: Formatting dates in org-capture templates

----

Text:

I track my weight in an Org-mode table. New entries are added using an Org-mode capture template. It was bugging me that the date format was a full-on Org-mode inactive timestamp like `[2024-01-01 Mon]`. I just wanted the `YYYY-MM-DD` portion, but Org's expansion templates don't have an option for that. 

I learned today that I can use any Emacs (link: https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Time-Parsing.html#index-format_002dtime_002dstring text: date format) string in the capture template. I'm using `%<%F>` which displays the ISO 8601 date, just like I want.

```lisp
("W" "Weight" table-line
    (file+olp "~/org/daybook.org" "Weight Tracking" "Data")
     "| %<%F> | %? | | |"
     :unnarrowed t)
```

I learn something every day.
