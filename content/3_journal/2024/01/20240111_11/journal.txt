Alice was up at 3:30 which is a little early, but at least we got to have a nice long walk through a beautiful blanket of fresh snow.

I'm still waffling on what to do with this very text you're reading. It's part of the "Journal" entry content in Kirby, which I don't include in the RSS feed. I love this because it gives me a less public space to ramble about whatever. It's sort of a personal journal that people crazy enough can read if the wish to. The problem is that nearly everything I post *could* be a real note post (such as those below). Those get published to the feed and also have their own separate page, which I like. Anyway, I guess I'll just keep making it up as I go along.
