Title: My wiki is priceless

----

Text:

Here, I think out loud about my wiki [wiki.baty.net](https://wiki.baty.net). 

The wiki (built using TiddlyWiki) is chock full of old notes and ideas and journal entries. 3,674 of them since 2018, to be precise.

I need to remember this whenever I drift away from using it as a place for dumping links and quotes and conversations and *anything* else. Click the "random tiddler" link a few times. Wow, how fun!

Here's the thing: Emacs.

Once I started putting *everything* in Emacs, it no longer made sense to duplicate those things in TiddlyWiki. Except what I'm finding is that I prefer dropping little one-off notes in the wiki to creating a org-mode file using Denote  in Emacs. And I also quite often prefer browsing and finding things in the wiki.

This is a problem. My system has grown to depend on everything being in my ~/org folder. Wiki stuff isn't. I don't think I care anymore. The stuff I put in the wiki is just as findable and future-proof, and it's potentually more *valuable* because I like using it there and it's also public so someone might find a helpful nugget or two.

I guess what I'm saying is that I'd like to go back to putting my notes that can be public in the wiki instead of org-mode.
