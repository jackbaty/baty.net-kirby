Text: I've spent some time this week toying with the idea of using Logseq for my daily logging. I prefer writing in outliners and Logseq's outline-based blocks are handy and easy to deal with. Linking is fast and easy. There are queries for when I need to get fancy. Easy, automatic daily notes makes Logseq a tool well-suited to daily notes.
