One reason I avoid taking part in politic discussions with strangers in most contexts is that there's no longer such a thing as a political discussion. It always, always devolves to just yelling at and past each other and I want no part of that. I don't know how to avoid that part of it, so I avoid all of it. (This is of course based on my definition of "political", which tends to be yet another sticking point in the whole scenario).

Speaking of politics, my (81-year-old) mom is laid up with a broken ankle and I was visiting her this morning. We were talking politics (see!?) and so then, of course, Trump came up. She eventually just shook her head and said, "I just want to cut off his lips!" and we moved to other topics.
