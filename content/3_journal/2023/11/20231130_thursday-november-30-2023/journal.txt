I've made a few Kirby changes, so please yell if you spot any issues. I'm using the Markdown Field plugin, now that it's compatible with v4. I also updated the RSS feed to include cover images, when available.

I'm already tired of the Kissinger takes.

Received an email from Arc support that today's release fixes the bug I (and probably others) reported recently. Downloads were being saved to the Desktop rather than the folder configured Arc's settings (~/Downloads). Nice.
