Summary: I didn't move the blog back to Hugo or WordPress today, so that's something, right?

I added the Kirby Retour plugin so I could keep an eye on failures and easily add redirects. It works great, but then when I deployed (via Rsync) some other changes later, it deleted the data and all my routes because I had forgotten to exclude those from the sync. Mornings like this I wish I was using WordPress or something.

I keep reading advice to "...pick something and stick with it" and I JUST CAN'T OKAY?!

Speaking of, I may move baty.net back to WordPress (or Hugo?!) soon. Don't ask. UPDATE: After spending a few hours prepping WordPress, then changing my mind and prepping Hugo, I just ended up leaving Kirby for now. Not a productive afternoon.

Another Kirby-related note, sorry. I'm not enjoying having code and content split between local and server trees. I may go back to editing content locally and "deploying" via my Makefile. It's an extra step, but it makes other things less confusing and error prone. The only weird thing is the Retour plugin data. That has to remain server-only.
