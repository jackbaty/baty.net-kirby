Title: But you ARE building a web browser

----

Text: I love Arc. It's great. The team building Arc is enthusiastic, talented, and obviously love what they're doing. But I have to admit that their year-end video "(link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2-d5Sty-K0 text: We're not building a web browser)" has me a little concerned. I mean, you *are* building a web browser. Be excited, sure, but calm down a little on the change-the-world rhetoric. It's still a web browser. And the "I remember when I used Apple. My kids use Arc." was dreamy nonsense.
