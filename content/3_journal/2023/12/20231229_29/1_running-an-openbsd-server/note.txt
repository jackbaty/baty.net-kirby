Title: Running an OpenBSD Server

----

Text: Derek Sivers has this (link: https://sive.rs/ti text: Technological Independence) thing meant to help people run a little server for all their services. I don't need it, but it's been so long since I've run a BSD server that I gave it a whirl. It's fun! I now have a $5 VPS at Vultr running web, mail, CalDAV, CardDAV, and storage.
