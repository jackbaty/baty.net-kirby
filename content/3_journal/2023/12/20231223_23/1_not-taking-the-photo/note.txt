Title: Not taking the photo

----

Text: I was walking down a sidewalk and passed a man wearing a hard hat and face shield that was tipped up so it didn't hit the cigarette hanging from his mouth. He had a great face and I thought it could make a fun photo. But, I was too chicken to ask him if I could photograph him and just nodded as I walked by. I'm ashamed of myself and it makes me want to sell it all and find another hobby.
