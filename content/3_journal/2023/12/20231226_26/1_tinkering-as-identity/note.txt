Title: Tinkering as identity?

----

Text: Whenever I see others refer to me or my blog, it's usually along the lines of "he changes his blog a lot...". This is fine, because I do, but I'm wondering if this is what I'd like to be remembered for. Wouldn't it be better to be remembered for my photographs, my writing, or art, or being otherwise useful to the world?
