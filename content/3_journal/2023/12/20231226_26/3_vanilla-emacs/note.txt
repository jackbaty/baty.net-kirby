Title: Vanilla Emacs

----

Text: Not long ago, I spent time&mdash;lots of time&mdash;building my own Emacs config from scratch. It got to a pretty good point before I realized I was just my own shitty version of Doom Emacs. So, I punted and went back to Doom. I've been using my vanilla config all day today and it's...not bad. It actually feels faster in action than Doom. But, there are so many nice little quality-of-life improvements provided by Doom that I fear I'll never get there. Still, it feels good to be running something that's all mine.
