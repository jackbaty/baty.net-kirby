> And it’s been a good reminder to myself that talking too much about politics, on X or elsewhere, is indeed a limiting prospective. So I’ve gladly turned it down or taken it private. Like the olden days, before we were fooled into thinking that sharing every thought about every hot-button political issue in every social circle was going to advance us all somehow. It wasn’t, it didn’t, and it won’t.

I'll bet you a million zillion dollars that this is 100% a response to internal (and probably external) pressures to shut the fuck up about politics. At least he got his usual defense of Musk and a jab at "certain groups of people" in there. DHH is kind of brilliant, but I've lost my respect for him has a human.
