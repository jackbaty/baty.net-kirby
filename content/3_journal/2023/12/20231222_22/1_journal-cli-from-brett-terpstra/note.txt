Title: Journal CLI from Brett Terpstra

----

Text: I sometimes toy with using (link: https://brettterpstra.com/projects/journal-cli/ text: Journal) from Brett Terpstra. It's fun to type "journal daily" in a terminal, fill in some details, and have both JSON and Markdown versions and also an entry in Day One. It's just that I don't need another place for recording my day right now. Worth a look, for sure, if you haven't.
