Title: Doing to Day One

----

Text: TIL that Brett added an output format to (link: https://brettterpstra.com/projects/doing/ text: Doing) which (link: https://github.com/ttscoff/doing/wiki/Exporting-to-Day-One text: sends entries directly to Day One). This nicely replaces my own convoluted shell scripts which did the same thing, but badly.
