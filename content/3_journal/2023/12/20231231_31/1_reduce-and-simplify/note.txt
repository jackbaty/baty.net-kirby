Text:

If forced to come up with a theme for 2024, I'm going with "Reduce & Simplify".

I haven't formally defined it yet, but the gist of it is to use what I already have, remove things I rarely use, and rely on fewer, simpler things.

Having many choices is great, until it's not. I crossed that threshold a while ago and it's not good for my brain.
